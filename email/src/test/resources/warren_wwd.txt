as a correction officer I believe that at times people forget how imporant 
one person privacey is what we may saw to some one in passing we tend to 
forget how fast the inmate grape vine is and what inmates can do with bits 
and pieces of information they here we forget we told officer john about my 
new car. So please stress this to officers being in a small town everybody 
nose everybody buisness. So where do the heppa law go infect with this one.

Subject:	Inmate privacecy after release

Governor I am a former correction officer writing you. I know as a 
correction officer I always was worried about inmates knowing where I lived 
and the safety of my family. I understand that this  is something that you 
made sure we always was safe and showed us how to protect ourselves. But, I 
guess we forgot about the imates and thier family. If I killed somebody I 
would not want the family knowing where I lived or my relased date. I would 
be very nervous as a female if a officer got my address and wrote me I 
cannot do anything because it is public knowledge. Is there anything that 
can be done for these inmates how do we include them in the heppea law.

From ghost correction offcer.

Subject:	Re: need help with damaging records

Dear Warren:

The reason I wrote the Governor is because I need a legislator, not a  
litigator.

I am going to sue the State of Florida?  No.

I am currently trying to settle a case against a public entity that  
for now will remain unnamed in hopes you listening.

The entity erroneously stigmatizing Military Discharge documents ,  
albeit it at all times Honorable, to deny me employment.  They wish  
to settle.

Their insurance company's lawyer says they NOT mark the records as  
Confidential and separate them from the rest of the applicant records  
unless we show him statutory authority.  My sister was an attorney in  
the Florida Dept. of Labor in Tallahassee and has sated that they do  
this there AND many persons my attorneys have contacted have found  
that lots of people practice that concept, yet, there is no statutory  
authority for it.

The Sunshine Laws need to be "tweaked" so that documents that have  
been declared null and void and erroneously stigmatizing are EXEMPT  
from this law.

As a Disabled American Veteran the VA paid for me to to FSU.  I got a  
teaching degree.  I refused to relinquish the discharge papers in  
Leon County when I applied to teach.  I understand their position, it  
was my prerogative, I lost out.  Since then I moved to another  
Florida County and decided that since there is no National teach  
check and a teacher must apply in every single county each time they  
seek employment across the entire country and since I was still  
chipping away at the Army to correct this injustice as per the  
original U.S. Court of Claims order, my life must go on and so I had  
to turn over the documents.

I had a corrective document, and DD215.  However, that is not a  
standalone document so I had to also hand over the document that it  
corrects, DD214.

The DD214 could say anything, but it is WRONG, never happened!  It  
could say molested kids or killed 14 people!  Whatever you want, take  
your pick.  IT's WRONG and therefore erroneously stigmatizes me.  As  
soon I told the Army Review Boards Agency (a very powerful agency)  
they immediately a issued a NEW and completely "clean" (their word)  
DD214, along with a letter stating all previously issued Discharge  
documents should be destroyed.

I was still talking to the potential employer, who went so far as to  
ask me for court documents!  I sent them the new DD214 and the letter.

It was too late.  They had seen the erroneous information and thus I  
was prejudiced.  Now I have use under the ADA for a "perceived  
disability."  The EEOC helped nothing despite their own rules.


When asked, before any EEOC or court complaint, why they did not hire  
me, they cited those documents!  Had they NOT done that they would  
have "gotten away with it."

I do not not need litigation.  I repeat, please.. look at this way...  
on you r last day of office commit a good, decent, random act of  
kindness... pull a few strings... call it "Ted's law", but get the  
Sunshine Law tweaked so that exempts court ruled erroneous, false,  
documents that in the wrong hands --anyone can get them-- can ruined  
a persons life!

HELP!

Ted Rogers

  Hello,



         Thank you for the quick & friendly response!
The phone number you provided to me was later called
by me & I discovered they did not handle such matters,
they gave me a Tampa phone number (1-800-226-1140), I
spoke with the Tampa agency & explained the turmoil
but they transferred me to the Lakeland agency (no
phone number given to me as it was a direct transfer).


  The Lakeland agency said I had to speak with the
Chief of the Winter Haven station where the original
complaint was placed. I explained to the Lakeland
agency that I had left messages for the current chief
& all have not been replied to up to that point. After
I got off the phone I called the chief once more
(third phone call to chief of WH police)and left it on
his voice mail at the station location phone number.
This station was also ffwd & CC'ed an email explaining
this complaint from another email source
(amercer@fpca.com)that deals with Florida police &
that email was also not replied to, at this email
address.

Please advise as how I can get anywhere with this
stunning conduct performed by the Winter Haven police
department? I wish to give a full detailed explanation
about the incident which occurred on October 29th 2006
& also explain how I was not informed about how to
proceed after I filed the original Complaint on
October 31st 2006, as I was given no names or numbers
(among other things) to advise me on how to give a
recorded statement.


Sincerely,



Seth Saltzman

Dear Mr. Davis,
 
I want to thank you on behalf of the family for your response to my email.  However, that is what the family has encountered throughout this ordeal, no one is willing to listen to them, therefore every effort they have put forth to getting the truth out about their brother has not come to fruition.  They have a letter prepared with a few attached documents that they have sent to Gov. Bush with the hopes that he will at least look at them.  There are letters from the "alleged victim" and her sister and their mother, all stating that he did not touch her and she was told to say those things by her aunt and HRS or she would never see her mother again.  
 
Lacy Mahon was the attorney of record and when he was confronted about his misrepresentation of their brother and how things were so botched, Mr. Mahon committed suicide, the whole case is strung with things like that and someone really needs to get to the bottom of it. 
 
Sadly, this case reads like a John Grisham novel of small town injustice.
 
I am afraid that their only  hope of getting to the bottom of what really happened to their brother is to involve an investigative reporter (however that may compound what is already going on, who knows anymore).  
 
Thank you and the Governor and Lt. Governor for responding.  I will pass on  your email to them.  I really do appreciate the time you took to read the email and respond, that means a lot and it will mean a lot to this family.
 
Regards to you all and have a wonderful healthy and happy New Year!!!

Dear Denese:
 
Thank you for writing to Lieutenant Governor Toni Jennings.  The Lieutenant Governor understands the pain a prisoner's family and friends endure and asked me to respond on her behalf.
 
Questions about the guilt or innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to commit a crime, or the procedural fairness of their convictions must be addressed in the courts. Those who wish to contest judicial rulings should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available. If you need assistance in locating an attorney, contact the Florida Bar's Attorney Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.
 
Decisions over prisoners' movement within the system, rehabilitative or educational programs, temporary release permission, and incentive gain time are under the authority of the Department of Corrections.  For further assistance, please write to Department of Corrections, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2500.
 
The Florida Parole Commission, an entity independent of the Governor's control, determines the issues of control release and early release.  The Commission's address is Building C, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida  32399-2450.
 
Thank you again for writing.  The Lieutenant Governor and Governor Bush hope this information is helpful.

Dear Mrs. Jennings:
 
I am writing to ask where we should send a letter in hopes that Mr. Bush would review the same.  We also have back up information to substantiate the families case.
 
This family has a member of their family who is serving time in Starke Florida for a crime he did not commit.  I am not one to usually get on the band wagon for such a cause, but after reading all of the back up information I told them I would try to help.  This man has been in Starke for 21 years for allegedly abusing his step daughter, however there are letters from the wife and other daughter who say that Mr. Hickox did not commit this crime and that the step daughter was told by another family  member to say these things, she would not recant her story for fear of being locked up herself, but all of their letters seem to fall on deaf ears.  This is a poor family and Mr. Hickox has never been written up for any thing since  his incarceration.  It seems that no attorney wants to get involved in even looking over these documents and he and his family are distraught.  He is supposed to be up for parole after serving 25 years but they say he isn't even listed with the parole board.
 
Could you please point us in the right direction to some legal counsel that you think would at least hear this family out, meet with them and give them some assistance.  I feel this would be a feather in someone's cap if they could get this innocent man pardoned after spending 21 years in prison for a crime he did not commit.   It appears to have been a kangaroo court that convicted this man, you should read these documents they boggle the mind.
 
Thank you for your time and for any assistance you can give them.
 
Regards,
Denese

Dear Governor, TodayDec27, 2006 I received a form letter response from Warren Davis to my letter that I sent Dec 6,2006. As it is a duplicate of the reply my daughter received to her letter to you, I think someone has been getting paid for doing nothing, at least not reading letters sent to you. First of all they will never convince me you have seen my letter. Second, good old Warren is either totally incompetent or did not read my letter either as he did not address the main point which was to try and make sure my brother received his medicine. As it seems to be Florida's preference to incarcerate people with depression and mental problems whose crime had no victim and at the same time release whore school teachers who rape young boys, or a professional football player who beats up on people and  whose father just happens to be a Chief of Police in a Flordia town, it does not suprise me that Florida will not make available proper mediacation for those who need it. In closing please save the Florida taxpayers the cose of a stamp for a ridiculous form letter that completely ignores the thrust of the letter.    Al Doyle

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that should be resolved through the court system.  If you are unhappy with a ruling or feel a case has not been handled according to the law, you should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available.  For those unable to afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services or the county legal aid association has information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone number of Florida Legal Services is (850) 385-7900.  Those dissatisfied with their representatives should consider choosing another attorney.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.  Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.

Sincerely,



Warren Davis
Office of Citizens' Services
