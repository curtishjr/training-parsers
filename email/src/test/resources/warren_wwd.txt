as a correction officer I believe that at times people forget how imporant 
one person privacey is what we may saw to some one in passing we tend to 
forget how fast the inmate grape vine is and what inmates can do with bits 
and pieces of information they here we forget we told officer john about my 
new car. So please stress this to officers being in a small town everybody 
nose everybody buisness. So where do the heppa law go infect with this one.

Subject:	Inmate privacecy after release

Governor I am a former correction officer writing you. I know as a 
correction officer I always was worried about inmates knowing where I lived 
and the safety of my family. I understand that this  is something that you 
made sure we always was safe and showed us how to protect ourselves. But, I 
guess we forgot about the imates and thier family. If I killed somebody I 
would not want the family knowing where I lived or my relased date. I would 
be very nervous as a female if a officer got my address and wrote me I 
cannot do anything because it is public knowledge. Is there anything that 
can be done for these inmates how do we include them in the heppea law.

From ghost correction offcer.

Subject:	Re: need help with damaging records

Dear Warren:

The reason I wrote the Governor is because I need a legislator, not a  
litigator.

I am going to sue the State of Florida?  No.

I am currently trying to settle a case against a public entity that  
for now will remain unnamed in hopes you listening.

The entity erroneously stigmatizing Military Discharge documents ,  
albeit it at all times Honorable, to deny me employment.  They wish  
to settle.

Their insurance company's lawyer says they NOT mark the records as  
Confidential and separate them from the rest of the applicant records  
unless we show him statutory authority.  My sister was an attorney in  
the Florida Dept. of Labor in Tallahassee and has sated that they do  
this there AND many persons my attorneys have contacted have found  
that lots of people practice that concept, yet, there is no statutory  
authority for it.

The Sunshine Laws need to be "tweaked" so that documents that have  
been declared null and void and erroneously stigmatizing are EXEMPT  
from this law.

As a Disabled American Veteran the VA paid for me to to FSU.  I got a  
teaching degree.  I refused to relinquish the discharge papers in  
Leon County when I applied to teach.  I understand their position, it  
was my prerogative, I lost out.  Since then I moved to another  
Florida County and decided that since there is no National teach  
check and a teacher must apply in every single county each time they  
seek employment across the entire country and since I was still  
chipping away at the Army to correct this injustice as per the  
original U.S. Court of Claims order, my life must go on and so I had  
to turn over the documents.

I had a corrective document, and DD215.  However, that is not a  
standalone document so I had to also hand over the document that it  
corrects, DD214.

The DD214 could say anything, but it is WRONG, never happened!  It  
could say molested kids or killed 14 people!  Whatever you want, take  
your pick.  IT's WRONG and therefore erroneously stigmatizes me.  As  
soon I told the Army Review Boards Agency (a very powerful agency)  
they immediately a issued a NEW and completely "clean" (their word)  
DD214, along with a letter stating all previously issued Discharge  
documents should be destroyed.

I was still talking to the potential employer, who went so far as to  
ask me for court documents!  I sent them the new DD214 and the letter.

It was too late.  They had seen the erroneous information and thus I  
was prejudiced.  Now I have use under the ADA for a "perceived  
disability."  The EEOC helped nothing despite their own rules.


When asked, before any EEOC or court complaint, why they did not hire  
me, they cited those documents!  Had they NOT done that they would  
have "gotten away with it."

I do not not need litigation.  I repeat, please.. look at this way...  
on you r last day of office commit a good, decent, random act of  
kindness... pull a few strings... call it "Ted's law", but get the  
Sunshine Law tweaked so that exempts court ruled erroneous, false,  
documents that in the wrong hands --anyone can get them-- can ruined  
a persons life!

HELP!

Ted Rogers

  Hello,



         Thank you for the quick & friendly response!
The phone number you provided to me was later called
by me & I discovered they did not handle such matters,
they gave me a Tampa phone number (1-800-226-1140), I
spoke with the Tampa agency & explained the turmoil
but they transferred me to the Lakeland agency (no
phone number given to me as it was a direct transfer).


  The Lakeland agency said I had to speak with the
Chief of the Winter Haven station where the original
complaint was placed. I explained to the Lakeland
agency that I had left messages for the current chief
& all have not been replied to up to that point. After
I got off the phone I called the chief once more
(third phone call to chief of WH police)and left it on
his voice mail at the station location phone number.
This station was also ffwd & CC'ed an email explaining
this complaint from another email source
(amercer@fpca.com)that deals with Florida police &
that email was also not replied to, at this email
address.

Please advise as how I can get anywhere with this
stunning conduct performed by the Winter Haven police
department? I wish to give a full detailed explanation
about the incident which occurred on October 29th 2006
& also explain how I was not informed about how to
proceed after I filed the original Complaint on
October 31st 2006, as I was given no names or numbers
(among other things) to advise me on how to give a
recorded statement.


Sincerely,



Seth Saltzman

Dear Mr. Davis,
 
I want to thank you on behalf of the family for your response to my email.  However, that is what the family has encountered throughout this ordeal, no one is willing to listen to them, therefore every effort they have put forth to getting the truth out about their brother has not come to fruition.  They have a letter prepared with a few attached documents that they have sent to Gov. Bush with the hopes that he will at least look at them.  There are letters from the "alleged victim" and her sister and their mother, all stating that he did not touch her and she was told to say those things by her aunt and HRS or she would never see her mother again.  
 
Lacy Mahon was the attorney of record and when he was confronted about his misrepresentation of their brother and how things were so botched, Mr. Mahon committed suicide, the whole case is strung with things like that and someone really needs to get to the bottom of it. 
 
Sadly, this case reads like a John Grisham novel of small town injustice.
 
I am afraid that their only  hope of getting to the bottom of what really happened to their brother is to involve an investigative reporter (however that may compound what is already going on, who knows anymore).  
 
Thank you and the Governor and Lt. Governor for responding.  I will pass on  your email to them.  I really do appreciate the time you took to read the email and respond, that means a lot and it will mean a lot to this family.
 
Regards to you all and have a wonderful healthy and happy New Year!!!

Dear Denese:
 
Thank you for writing to Lieutenant Governor Toni Jennings.  The Lieutenant Governor understands the pain a prisoner's family and friends endure and asked me to respond on her behalf.
 
Questions about the guilt or innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to commit a crime, or the procedural fairness of their convictions must be addressed in the courts. Those who wish to contest judicial rulings should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available. If you need assistance in locating an attorney, contact the Florida Bar's Attorney Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.
 
Decisions over prisoners' movement within the system, rehabilitative or educational programs, temporary release permission, and incentive gain time are under the authority of the Department of Corrections.  For further assistance, please write to Department of Corrections, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2500.
 
The Florida Parole Commission, an entity independent of the Governor's control, determines the issues of control release and early release.  The Commission's address is Building C, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida  32399-2450.
 
Thank you again for writing.  The Lieutenant Governor and Governor Bush hope this information is helpful.

Dear Mrs. Jennings:
 
I am writing to ask where we should send a letter in hopes that Mr. Bush would review the same.  We also have back up information to substantiate the families case.
 
This family has a member of their family who is serving time in Starke Florida for a crime he did not commit.  I am not one to usually get on the band wagon for such a cause, but after reading all of the back up information I told them I would try to help.  This man has been in Starke for 21 years for allegedly abusing his step daughter, however there are letters from the wife and other daughter who say that Mr. Hickox did not commit this crime and that the step daughter was told by another family  member to say these things, she would not recant her story for fear of being locked up herself, but all of their letters seem to fall on deaf ears.  This is a poor family and Mr. Hickox has never been written up for any thing since  his incarceration.  It seems that no attorney wants to get involved in even looking over these documents and he and his family are distraught.  He is supposed to be up for parole after serving 25 years but they say he isn't even listed with the parole board.
 
Could you please point us in the right direction to some legal counsel that you think would at least hear this family out, meet with them and give them some assistance.  I feel this would be a feather in someone's cap if they could get this innocent man pardoned after spending 21 years in prison for a crime he did not commit.   It appears to have been a kangaroo court that convicted this man, you should read these documents they boggle the mind.
 
Thank you for your time and for any assistance you can give them.
 
Regards,
Denese

Dear Governor, TodayDec27, 2006 I received a form letter response from Warren Davis to my letter that I sent Dec 6,2006. As it is a duplicate of the reply my daughter received to her letter to you, I think someone has been getting paid for doing nothing, at least not reading letters sent to you. First of all they will never convince me you have seen my letter. Second, good old Warren is either totally incompetent or did not read my letter either as he did not address the main point which was to try and make sure my brother received his medicine. As it seems to be Florida's preference to incarcerate people with depression and mental problems whose crime had no victim and at the same time release whore school teachers who rape young boys, or a professional football player who beats up on people and  whose father just happens to be a Chief of Police in a Flordia town, it does not suprise me that Florida will not make available proper mediacation for those who need it. In closing please save the Florida taxpayers the cose of a stamp for a ridiculous form letter that completely ignores the thrust of the letter.    Al Doyle

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that should be resolved through the court system.  If you are unhappy with a ruling or feel a case has not been handled according to the law, you should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available.  For those unable to afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services or the county legal aid association has information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone number of Florida Legal Services is (850) 385-7900.  Those dissatisfied with their representatives should consider choosing another attorney.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.  Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.

Sincerely,



Warren Davis
Office of Citizens' Services

Subject:  Rosa C. Figarola & Deborah White-Labora

Dear Mister Jeb Bush and Mister Charlie Crist:

These two people, Rosa C. Figarola & Deborah White-Labora, are two "judges" in Miami-Dade County.  They have committed a government crime against me.

Last year, I was hired as an accounting clerk in a "law firm" named "Spiegel & Utrera, P.A." located at Miami, Florida.  I was hired by the controller of this business.  This controller was a very old gay man.  But from the very beginning of my employment, I was sexually harassed by this old gay man controller who aimed at a sexual affair in the office.  I did not abide by such evil supervisory power and never responded to the sexual affair suggestion in any way.  

The old gay man felt powerless and looked for ways to charge me and to fire me.  At last, this controller charged me of breaking the employment law on Racial Discrimination because I asked some Hispanic/Black employees to turn off Black Neighborhood Music when we were all at work.  I was fired through this course.

After I got fired, I only contacted the owner of Spiegel & Utrera, P.A. for the wrongful discharge.  But Spiegel kept his controller and refused to talk to me.  After an altogether six-month of respectful contact, I noticed Spiegel that I would go to his office to talk about my employment case.  Spiegel still did not respond me.  When I got to his office, I discovered that he had called police charging me of trespassing.  In addition to that, he released his old gay man controller to American Family Court trying to file an injunction against me charging me Sexual, Dating, Repeat & Domestic Violence.

Rosa C. Figarola & Deborah White-Laborah

Rosa C. Figarola gave the old gay man controller a denying petition, but instead of marking that the accusations did not meet the criteria of an American Family Court injunction.  She marked something else alleging that the old gay man controller's accusations did meet the criteria of American Family Court values and hence she subpoenaed me to American Family Court to meet the old gay man controller.

When I received Rosa C. Figarola's American Family Court paper, I felt I was sexually assaulted.  I felt so ill, sick and disgusting that I wanted to request two policemen accompanying me to American Family Court to see Rosa C. Figarola and the old gay man controller.

Under the threat from Rosa C. Figarola's American Family Court paper that I would be arrested if I would not go to her American Family Court, I surrendered and went into American Family Court to see Rosa C. Figarola and the old gay man controller.  Waiting for me was Deborah White-Laborah and the old gay man controller.

Inside her American Family Court, Deborah White-Laborah called me bad names such as "crazy", "mentally ills" and "need to take pills" and said to me that I would be given a permanent American Family Court injunction if I would continue contact Spiegel & Utrera for my employment case, which meaned I would be denied all employment opportunities.  She then gave me an extension of the original denying order telling me NOT to contact Spiegel & Utrera for my employment case.  Even the old gay man controller could NOT believe that Deborah White-Laborah spoke out like that.  

I sent lots of email to various government officials asking for a sound judgement upon this case.  I said that I had all along gone after the owner of the business, NOT the old gay man, for justice in my employment case.  I could NEVER let this case go because not only the old gay man controller sexually harassed me and retaliated by various power abuses.  The most offensive part in this case is charging me of breaking the employment law on Racial Discrimination for asking Hispanic/Black employees turn off Black Neighborhood Music while we all at work.  In the recent decades, America has already been in the dark tyranny of Black Power.  In addition, please remember that the office was located in a very fine neighborhood and that the business held itself to the public as a professional office.

Therefore, I continue went after the owner of the business for justice by contacting him and  various regulating offices, one of which was his old gay man controller's professional license.  Because I did NOT believe the old gay man controller met the ethic standard of a professional accountant.  

Spiegel & Utrera used that information from me and went to American Police charging me of breaking American Family Court Values of Sexual, Dating, Repeating and Domestic Violence.  American Police listened to Spiegel & Utrera, arrested me and put me into American Jail.  My employment, my financial security and my housing security hence fell into jeopardy.  

Right before American Police arrested me (instead of arresting Spiegel & Utrera), I saw in my vision that the old gay man controller and Deborah White-Laborah were perpetrating something against me and they were like close personal friends or even relatives.  I saw that I vomited blood.  While I was "screwed" into American Jail, I was again sent to see Deborah White-Laborah.  And when she named the old gay man controller to me, she purposefully sounded abnormally personal trying to confirm something with me.

A supposed Court of Justice, under Rosa C. Figarola & Deborah White-Laborah's leadership, became a place of dark crime.  The government has committed a crime upon me because some members of the government wanted to see me "mess" with illegitimate males such as black man or gay man.  They perpetrated this dark crime against me.  When I was just hired, member of the underground government, Paul Harvey, announced on radio that I would go through a "911" (messing with an old gay man).  I did NOT accept the old gay man to any personal level and so they had the old gay man fire me and make bad charge against me in American Family Court just to sexually violate me in a spiritual way.

As of today, 25 December 2006, American Criminal Court, in the hand of the criminal underground government, still charge me of violating a denying restraining order and stalking the old gay man controller.  Because I went after owner of the business for his sheltering his controller's sexual harassment, retaliation, abuse of supervisory power, taking advantage of the tyrannic Black Power, abuse of the Employment Law on Racial Discrimination, making bad call to police, and filing bad papers in American Courts.

What Rosa C. Figarola and Deborah White-Laborah did to me is a dark, heinous crime unbelievable to average people.  And they perpetrated this dark crime within a place supposedly for Truth and Justice.  Allowing Rosa C. Figarola and Deborah White-Laborah to continue stay at Judgeship can only darken the color of America and discredit the name of court.

The government needs to review this case and restore Justice for America, American Court and American Judgeship.  Rosa C. Figarola and Deborah White-Labora must be removed.

Very Truly Yours, 
  Nancy Min Ji
25 December 2006

Dear Warren Davis:  Please know that I am a victim of these two female's criminal conducts.  I do NOT need to appeal their court behaviors to convince I am innocent.  These two females have intentionally abused judgeship in hand, disregarded basic common sense and basic human values, and committed criminal activities against me.  I do not think they can continue stay at judgeship.  If the governor can appoint a judge, why cannot the governor remove a judge?  The governor know well that I am not talking about appeal a normal court ruling, but the character and behavioral aspects of these two "judges".  They raped me spiritually and disrupted my life in a horrible way --- family wise, friends wise, job wise, income wise, housing wise.  They have committed criminal activities against me, against court justice and against human well-being.  I am being very tender when only asking for "removal" because these two females deserved to be prosecuted.  It will be irresponsible for the governor not to remove these two people from judgeship.  ---  Nancy Min Ji

Subject:	Re: Regulation by State of Florida

Importance:	High

Dear Warren Davis,

We have indicated before that we view this as a matter of state STATE 
REGULATION and any legal Counsel with
Yvonne's Property Management  will be considered as a SEPARATE issue. We are 
very concerned that the
STATE OF FLORIDA is not taking this matter seriously and this has led to a 
major adverse impact on MANY innocent taxpayers.

Who can we approach to register our complaint regarding apparent lack of 
state regulation of this 'white collar'
CRIMINAL activity/fraud?

Can we repeat:

We are not getting a response from Law Enforcement and wish to know that if 
even if Governor is not a member of the
Judicial Branch of Government surely SOMEONE IN THIS TAX FUNDED GOVERNMENT 
should be  worried about
the actions of Yvonne's and other such similar companies?

WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATION as it appears that companies like
Yvonne's are allowed to be 'above the law' through various loop holes?

Have you Honourable Jerry Hills EMAIL ADDRESS and can she/he advise on a
judicial review PROCESS?

Would you be helpful enough to supply information on whether our complaint 
should be registered to someone else in
Government and how this matter can be progressed if we are not satisfied 
with your (as the representative of Governor Jeb Bush) response?

At this stage we would like to inform you that we are now in contact with 
various independent agencies who may be able to better clarify our rights.

Sincerely,

Carmen Oliver, Bill San Phillips, Barbara Bedford , Bulraj Bassral, Dean

Mr. Davis,
                Isn't the Tax Collectors office funded by the DMV? This would make it a state agency. It would be hard to ask the tax collector why he is spending tax payer money for a perfectly legal function, obviously he has his own personal reasons as to why he doesn't want a union to form. If State Government can't look into a matter then why do we have Government? That would be like police departments policing themselves, wrong doing would never be found .Again I am asking for someone other than the tax collector himself to look into the matter as to why he has spent 90 plus thousand dollars to keep a union from forming in Brevard County.

Shame of you as politic.  Cause in your Resume as

...but thanks, that you stpo those kind dead, but too
late.  Why we have to wait, that things like that
happen, to stop those process. Why to let the people
suffer as Mr. Nieves did, to stopo and review the
prison process? Please, it's not necessary.

May the Lord Jesus stay with you and family.

Thank you Governor Bush, sincerely.

We are going through all of the court process, but my brother's three 
children have to be sent out of the country to stay with relatives in 
England.  They are American citizens and they are the ones suffering.  They 
have been without a mother and father for almost four years.  My brother and 
his wife did not kill anyone.  I believe they did more then enough time.

This is all over (replacement windows that the so called "victims", who by 
the way 85% were criminals)  I found all this out after the fact.  I did my 
own research and found lots of things on these witnesses, one even was 
arrested for being a watch out for a murder.  Two were child mostlers and 
after the wife testified against my brother, he was let out of prison and 
they move away out of Florida.

Another one beat his wife not once but twice.  DA McDonnell was at one time 
the supervisor for domestic violence.  They did not procute him, he 
testified.

The DA, had criminals manufacturer criminals.

And the story goes on.

But thank you again for hearing me out.

Happy Holidays to you and yours.

God Bless!!

Edwina

Warren, 

Thank you for getting back to me.  I'm sure the white children who use drugs in Escambia County's legalized crack smoking site for white children will be happy.  The problem is the local law enforcement and state attorney.  Smoke on kids!

This was the original email that we sent to you in September but as to yet 
have had no response. I thought i would send a quick update.
Doug Hall of the Central Florida Visa Group has since been arrested by the 
Polk County Sheriff but released on bail, with a $30,000 bond. He has been 
charged with grand theft, forgery, uttering forged inst and unlawful use of 
notery commission. As yet we have recieved no payment of the money owed us 
and nor does it look like we will recieve any! I am now on maternity leave 
with 7 days before our baby is due and are now facing a double mortgage etc, 
Not a good situtaion to be in! We have just found out that the USA 
immigration London have turned our visa applictaion down despite being 
approved by the USA side?

Importance: High



To Whom It May Concern;

 

I am in dire need of help Ive been litigating with my sister over an argument that escalated and dragged into the judicial system.  In a vindictive manner the mother was taken to court and a Judge granted the Aunt due to a physiological bond between Nephew and Aunt the Aunt was granted visitation.  The aunt provided childcare for the mother then refused and chosen to drag me into the court system.  I Cristina Lugones the mother have NEVER been found unfit; on the contrary I am a professional individual who is raising two children on my own.   Ive been investigated poked and probed.   The story is very in-depth and covers many issues that have not been addressed due to the unjust behavior of the attorneys involved and/or the Judge.  Ive been paying for an attorney here in Florida and the courts here have not yet taken jurisdiction.  I find it inconceivable that a Judge would grant this type of rights to an Aunt even after nothing was found for me to be judged.  Of course an Aunt and Nephew have a bond that is NOT enough to be granted any rights in the courts.  That indirectly means that a childcare provider can in fact receive standing to get visitation /partial custody of a child against a mother whether or not if there sisters.

I really need help in finding out my rights with my son.  After spending approximately $10,000.00 in the past year and a half now my funds have been depleted and I am unable to afford any attorney which is now hindering my from providing from my children.

Please contact me to assist me in knowing my rights.

 

If not I need a MIRACLE!

Dear Governor Bush:

Please let me start by saying that as a Governor, you have done a tremendous job for Florida, I wish we could have you another term, but Charlie Crist is OK as well.

Regarding the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz; to bad, so sad, etc..

He did not care about cruel and unusual punishment when he murdered that Miami topless bar manager 27 years ago. Does he think that the constitution applies to him now ? He (his family/ and or representatives for his  family), they did not  think about his victim's constitutional rights.

It saddens and sickens me that we have taken SO long to execute him.  I understand that appeals process must be carried out, but why? Why do we allow Death Row inmates to live, breath and be a burden on the great State of Florida for decades? Back in the day when you were found guilty by a death sentence crime you were hung in the town square within 30 days. That is long enough to get your affairs in order. Most don't have affairs to get in order, but in the event that they did, 30 days is more than enough time to accomplish this. After all, they did not give their victims time to get there affairs in order.

I know that you have suspended executions for a Commission Study, and I have to say I am most displeased. Our prisons are filled with criminals who don't want or care what is happening, they just want to waste the courts time and be given the rights under the constitution. Again, I disagree. Occasionally there is an innocent man in prison, but that is a rarity, not the rule. Yes technology can be wonderful, but if a jury of their peers sends them to prison, then something had to make them make that decision.

The trial, the verdict, death. So simple, and although he may have suffered, again, too bad!!!

I ask, what about the family of this man he murdered? Their husband, friend, lover, brother, son, father, uncle etc., was cruelly taken from them, gunned down and his murderer has been convicted. 27 years and he finally dies. So he dies a painful death, I am sure the death of his victim was painful also.

Why don't we truly start with sever punishment, arrested, verdict, death. No more screwing around because he has rights. Does he not forfeit his civil rights once he becomes a convicted felon? I have no sense of obligation or responsibility to find out what happened, IF a mistake was made, so be it. We are not all free from mistakes.

I wish just for once that we would truly get tough on crime, and start acting as they did in the old days. Hang em high, sell t-shirts, make some money for the state, and move on. Cut down on the millions of dollars spent to keep them alive. Clean off death row, and you have a a serious crime deterrent.

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush.  The Governor asked me to 
respond on his behalf.

Although the Governor appreciates the opportunity to review your concerns, 
this is a local government matter.  As you may know, our government is 
structured on the notion that local communities can best assess the needs of 
their residents.  You would do well to continue to work with your locally 
elected sheriff and state attorney's offices to resolve your concerns in 
this regard.

Of course, should you suspect a child is in any danger, notify your local 
law enforcement or the Department of Children and Families' hot line, 
1-800-96-ABUSE.

If Governor Bush can help you with a concern in the area of state 
government, please let him know.

                                                                        Sincerely,

I am so elated to see there is a place for a man to vent his frustrations 
concerning the act of being the victim of a domestic violence relationship.I 
was intended to marry a woman who had three children(triplets) of her own I 
had no children. We dated for approx. 5 years and I never could commit 
because her actions  continually  worsened after the first year.There were 
arguments about everything ,regardles if there were any problems. I soon 
found out ,in her mind there were always problems and therefore something to 
argue or critize me about.I will tell one story giving her reaction to give 
a general idea of her thinking,but there were many.On a business trip 
approximately three hours from home I approached the scene of a tragic 
traffic accident that had just seconds before happened. No one else would be 
present for approx.ten to fifteen minutes.Two young ladies from Texas were 
on there way to a rehersal dinner for a collage friend in Florida when they 
mistakenly passed a vehicle at the wrong time ,colliding head on with a 
gentleman in a pick-up truck Both vehicles were estimated to have been going 
70+ miles per hour .I immediately ran to the ladys car first.The driver was 
tangled in a mass of steel with one arm severed from what I could see at the 
time. I tore off a piece of a shirt and tied off the arteries. The car then 
started on fire. I rushed over to the truck and found a fire extinquisher in 
the back. I then put out the fire, but ther was just barely enough chemicals 
.If the fire had re-started there was nothing I coul have done. I then 
proceeded to remove the passenger from the car due to the possibility of the 
fire.I could not remove her from the car as she was pinned under the dash 
and the door was jammed. The driver was finally removed from the car when 
paramedics arrived and she was severed below the waist.There is a lot more 
incidents that occured,but I will get back to the purpose of telling the 
story.This was actually quite tramatic to me and even I am amased at how 
calmley I reacted.When I returned home to my spouse to be and told her of 
the story I was devistated by her response.She stated"See,that is how 
thoughtless you are.You don't stop to think about me or my children.What if 
one of those women would have had aids and you bring that home to me and my 
kids." I was speachless. Things worsened over the next year or so until I 
decided I had to get out.,but I was still curious as to why she acted with 
such unusual behavior.In my search for answers Iwent to a computer that was 
given to her by her "surrogate mother".It had burnt up about a year prior 
but when I contacted the computer tech he still had the system.I asked if he 
could reove the hard-drive ,out it in another system and see if there was 
anything that could help me to understand my situation. When he inserted the 
hard-drive he found most of what had been there was deleted. He then 
undeleted the hard-drive to find,at my amasement again,30,000 pictures of 
pornography.Everything you could possibly imagine from children to 
beasteality and everything in between.This woman is 62 years old,and lives 
alone with her husband of about same age ,except for every other weekend 
they keep the three children belonging to  what was to be my wife.I took 
this information to the mother of the children and that is where my 
nightmare began with her,the judicial system and the law. As soon as I told 
her of this woman having the pornography she went out and filed a domestic 
violence order against me.Since the filing she has managed to have me 
arrested twice,spend over$ 80,000 in attorney fees for ,what in actuality 
was her stalking me.When I was in the court ,facing these issues and at the 
same time trying to convince the Judge (by me I mean my counsel) what was 
really happening,including me having at the hearing witnesses that could 
verify everything Iwas saying and heard from her own mouth a different story 
than what she told the judge,the judge refused to let ANY of my witnesses 
speak.All of my witnesses were very respected people,I.E.,a 30 year state 
prosecutor,A captain on the police dept,a probation officer for the 
state,ect.,all of which knew the truth about this woman and were to testify 
on my behalf. The judge looks at the woman and asks"are you afraid for your 
life" to which she applies "yes" and he concluded the hearing,not allowing 
anyone to speak on my behalf.I feel by the existence of the porn and other 
things I have seen in the older couples residence ,the children are most 
likely being sodomized and the mother is aware of it.When I went to the 
police dept with the information ,they would do nothing stating there was a 
problem due to  "chain of command".I then understand by my own 
counsel,should I try and pursue the authorities with this information of 
pornography and very possible child abuse,that I would likely be charged by 
the judge, who issued the order,with a contempt charge of 
harrasement.Unbeleivable system...Sadly neglected children. To anyone 
reading this is there any recourse through a higher power than the court to 
get free from this woman and  help the children,although I have been told 
they are not my problem.I can't help but feel for them They are 9 years 
old.2boys and a girl.         jwconti@cox.net

Mr. Davis,

Thank you for your response. I just wanted to get my viewpoint across to 
you and Jeb regarding the death penalty. It just seems somewhat 
backwards and unenlightened to kill someone for a crime that they 
committed. I understand that families want retribution, I understand 
this all too well. But, to take a human life in response to the taking 
of a human life just doesn't make sense to me.

I should remark that I am infinitely impressed with your fair treatment 
of those who are accused of a crime. I am also incredibly impressed with 
your technological prowess concerning DNA testing and criminology.

I do see hypocrisy in certain people that endorse a death penalty, 
particularly in those that are pro-life. How can they say that a woman 
doesn't have a right to an abortion and yet it is alright to take a 
human life if that human is convicted of a heinous crime? But, I digress.

Thank you for listening to what I have to say and for taking my concern 
to heart. In conclusion, I would like to state again that I believe that 
the death penalty is a free ticket out of responsibility and that 
criminals that commit atrocities such as rape, child molestation and 
murder should be forced to live their days out in prison and doing 
community service.

Sincerely,
Ariel

In heinous murder cases in which a jury and judge have determined the convicted murderer deserves the ultimate punishment, Governor Bush believes, based on state law, the sentence should be carried out unless mitigating circumstances justify further consideration.

Unlike other states, Florida law requires the prosecutor to share evidence with the accused murderer's lawyer.  The accused is allowed access to DNA testing and other evidence that might demonstrate innocence.  Once a person is convicted of a capital murder, the death penalty may only be imposed if aggravating factors are proven to exist.  Thus, only first-degree murders that involve unspeakable cruelty and suffering, multiple victims, a motivation for financial gain, a desire to eliminate a witness, and other exceptionally brutal facts qualify for capital punishment.

Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.  Florida has provided more than $59 million in post-conviction legal representation to persons sentenced to death. No other state has invested the public resources in capital post conviction legal representation that Florida has been providing for well over a decade.

Very honoured governor Bush, 
 
today we in Germany get to know in the morning news from the gruesome execution of the capital punishment in a prisoner at the last night. We hear that the prisoner has passed away only after 34 agonising minutes after putting of the death syringe. Germans are horrified about this "modern" however still medieval execution method of the capital punishment. This practise throws a very bad light on your land and especially your state in which many Europeans are living.
 
Here it is not about the guilt which the convicted has loaded by his action on himself. It should be judged in no way slightly. No, it is about the method with which one of the most modern states of the world - the leadership nation of the free world - "carries" a citizen of your land in this "On the other side". This is unbelievable, stupefying, medieval. One feels reminded in the time of the inquisition of old Rome. We do not have the right to interfere in the internal problems of your policy. However, we are of the opinion that in an enlightened world, a constitutional state must differently handle with criminals to put also an example.

You have visited our land before some time and we are proud to be able to greet you. But, nevertheless, such events in your state cloud very much the understanding for each other. Beyond it, we are surprised very much that only few days before Christmas the capital punishment was carried out. Does nobody think then in your land about the family of the doomed man? It is very macabre! In hope that changes in this point something I wish you and your family blest Christmas. Hopefully you have it after this event. How you can go after this guilt to a church and pray there for the world, is incomprehensible to me.
 
Quiet and deferential greetings from Germany.

Your own words in your Executive Order regarding killing people by lethal injection condemn your state's practice of killing; the use of the terms "humanity" and "common sense" preclude any consideration of setting up a system for methodically destroying a human life.
 
The practice of immobilizing a human being while others stand and joke and watch him or her die may be acceptable in Iraq or Iran but it is not acceptable to decent people.  Why can't you do the right thing and stop playing God and stop this sanitized murder? 
 
Florida and Texas are leaders in brutality and their executions are a mockery of anything decent.

Governor Bush,

I appreciate your prompt response regarding my email.

I do believe the Florida Courts system as well as the Pennsylvania
system is has not taken in consideration what is in the best interest of
the child.  Especially what has lead up to the ordeal?  No one has
questioned any party WHY this has even became a "case".  To address the
best interest of the child, it's not to allow any contact with the
maternal aunt.  Even after her attempts to ruin our lives.  The Aunts
attorney references ALL LESIBAN cases to prove her point.  The aunt is
more financially stable in life, married to a corporal state trooper.
That does not give the right to a childcare provider due to an emotional
bond any standing.  On the contrary I, the mother work very hard and
maintain and have always taken care of my children it's been proven in
court also.  The maternal aunt JUST babysat.

I am almost 110% sure that each court system did not read the whole case
nor questioned the intentions of the prosecutor.  My attorney here has
submitted three appeals to the Florida court system and they have NOT
taken jurisdiction. It's as if the paperwork was not even read.  

My case needs attention I refuse to abide to such a ridiculous decision.
Is there a way I can find out how many attempt have been made to make
sure my money is going to the cause?
Thank you very much'

Dear Ms. Lugones:

Thank you for your recent e-mail to Governor Bush requesting assistance
with a child custody matter.  He has asked me to respond.
 
Custody and visitation rulings are under the jurisdiction of the
judicial system.  Under Florida law, the court's decision in these cases
is based on the best interest of the child or children involved.  Judges
review all of the information presented to them and apply the law to
make their decision.
 
The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters
that should be resolved through the court system.  If you are unhappy
with a ruling or feel a case has not been handled according to the law,
you should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be
available.  For those unable to afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services
or the county legal aid association has information about the
availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone number of Florida
Legal Services is (850) 385-7900.  Those dissatisfied with their
representatives should consider choosing another attorney.
 
Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the
problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.
Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.
 
Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern;
 
I am in dire need of help I've been litigating with my sister over an
argument that escalated and dragged into the judicial system.  In a
vindictive manner the mother was taken to court and a Judge granted the
Aunt due to a "physiological bond" between Nephew and Aunt the "Aunt"
was granted visitation.  The aunt provided childcare for the mother then
refused and chosen to drag me into the court system.  I Cristina Lugones
the mother have NEVER been found unfit; on the contrary I am a
professional individual who is raising two children on my own.   I've
been investigated poked and probed.   The story is very in-depth and
covers many issues that have not been addressed due to the unjust
behavior of the attorneys involved and/or the Judge.  I've been paying
for an attorney here in Florida and the courts here have not yet taken
jurisdiction.  I find it inconceivable that a Judge would grant this
type of rights to an Aunt even after nothing was found for me to be
judged.  Of course an Aunt and Nephew have a bond that is NOT enough to
be granted any rights in the courts.  That indirectly means that a
childcare provider can in fact receive standing to get visitation
/partial custody of a child against a mother whether or not if there
sisters.
I really need help in finding out my rights with my son.  After spending
approximately $10,000.00 in the past year and a half now my funds have
been depleted and I am unable to afford any attorney which is now
hindering my from providing from my children.

Subject:	Execution of Angel Nieves Diaz

Importance:	High

Dear Governor,
 
The following is an adaptation of a message I prepared, but unfortunately was not sent timely.
 
As I actually I do not know what if the execution is still pending and  I am convinced that  the main arguments presented are valid whatever the outcome might have been, i take the opportunity to present them. 
 
Angel Nieves Diaz was scheduled for execution on last December 13th for the assassination of Joseph Nagy in 1979, and I am hereby expressing my wishes  that death penalty was not applied.
 
Justice must be given to the family of Joseph Nagy: the assassinaion of a beloved one can never be adequately compensated.
 
But I feel that Justice is not necessarily served by applying the death penalty, the more so when actual doubts subsist about a trial proceedings and jury decisions. It is now common knowledge that Justice is often not as blind as one wishes, and that  a significant number of capital punishments have even been applied to innocent individuals.
 
In Angel Nieves Diaz case, ambiguous medical psychiatric evaluations in face of incoherent behaviour of the accused, his limited knowledge of english and clearly declared ignorance of basic legal means and procedures, imply his incompetence to represent himself in court.
 
Also weak, even contradictory  testimonies --- indeed actual lack of faithful testimonies in this case --- were reason enough for  the National Committee on Capital Punishement to defend, in 2002, the suspension of death penalties, especially  in situations such as Angel Nieves Diaz'.  
 
As common place as the sentence might be, a jury is composed of human beings, and having to judge a person of foreign descent  who defends him or herself feet and hand cuffed is prone to manifestations of insecurity which,  again in Angel Nieves Diaz case reveal themselves in far from unanimous decisions. 
 
I love the United States of America for many reasons. I often find myself defending the quality of its system of Justice and stating what I think are  reasons for it to be as it is. It pains me when I deeply feel that Justice might not have been served.
 
Dear Governor, if still possible, please stop this one more execution.
 
Yours Sicerely

her surrogate mothers pornography. I was supoened to court for this "false" 
accusation and from the beginning treated as a criminal.I had witnesses to 
totally repute the petionerers alligations.Extremely credible 
witnesses,I.E.,a state prosecuter of 35 years,a captian of the sherrifs 
dept.,a probation officer from the state,ect.The judge did not allow one of 
them to testify.The prosecuting attorney played games with the judge and my 
attorney on who made certain false statements and supplied the court with 
fraudelent documents.(between the prosecutor for the plantiff or the 
prosecutor herself) so the prosecutor is either seriously perjuring herself 
to the judge or the plantiff is and is being covered by the prosecutor. 
Regardless there are at least eight definite acts of perjury by the plantiff 
several more by her witnesses and possibly at least one by the prosecutor. 
Just for the purpose of reading if nothing else ,assume I am totally 
innocent.I have been put in jail twice(for the first time in my life of 51 
years)spent one day in the hospital ,costs of over $100.000.00  and can take 
no action on any proceedings against this person because it would be 
considered "harrasment" under the laws of domestic violence.Is this 
justice.The kicker is this happens to thousands of men a year,with pretty 
much the same story.They end up finanically broke,psychologically 
impaired,having to start a new life ,and have no recourse without the threat 
of being put in jail when they did nothing. Now,I am not minimizing the real 
problem of domestic violence,just the problem we now face with the abuse of 
this program ,like many others.The only difference is most fraud is someone 
taking from another ,rather it be the government,a fortune 500 company or a 
multi-millian dollar corporation like Enron.These people aren't as bad as 
the terrorist who targets one person,usually the one that has done the most 
for them and with the force of the law ruins many peoples lives.More  lives 
have been ruined by false accuzations of Domestic violence than from all of 
the corporate frauds,brave men fighting our wars and drunk drivers 
combined.This is an issue that has to be dealt with. I am working through 
people like yourself,News Media,O'Riley Factor,1000,s on the 
internet,organizations formed for the purpose of getting the message out to 
the "real" victum,which have thousands of readers and storys of their own.AS 
you can see this is nothing that be taken up with local authorities,first 
you are at extremely high risk for inprisonment ,second,you are branded 
"domestic Violence" ,a stigma that will taunt me for the rest of my life,and 
affect my life.It should not be allowed. There has to be outside 
intervention.There has to be a precidence set.This is the reason for my 
letter . In closing I would like to thank you for your time and appreciate 
your interest...Sincerely,William Conti Message -----

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush.  The Governor asked me to 
respond on his behalf.

Although the Governor appreciates the opportunity to review your concerns, 
this is a local government matter.  As you may know, our government is 
structured on the notion that local communities can best assess the needs of 
their residents.  You would do well to continue to work with your locally 
elected sheriff and state attorney's offices to resolve your concerns in 
this regard.

Of course, should you suspect a child is in any danger, notify your local 
law enforcement or the Department of Children and Families' hot line, 
1-800-96-ABUSE.

If Governor Bush can help you with a concern in the area of state 
government, please let him know.

                                                                        Sincerely,



                                                                        Warren

of Citizens' Services


I am so elated to see there is a place for a man to vent his frustrations 
concerning the act of being the victim of a domestic violence relationship.I 
was intended to marry a woman who had three children(triplets) of her own I 
had no children. We dated for approx. 5 years and I never could commit 
because her actions  continually  worsened after the first year.There were 
arguments about everything ,regardles if there were any problems. I soon 
found out ,in her mind there were always problems and therefore something to 
argue or critize me about.I will tell one story giving her reaction to give 
a general idea of her thinking,but there were many.On a business trip 
approximately three hours from home I approached the scene of a tragic 
traffic accident that had just seconds before happened. No one else would be 
present for approx.ten to fifteen minutes.Two young ladies from Texas were 
on there way to a rehersal dinner for a collage friend in Florida when they 
mistakenly passed a vehicle at the wrong time ,colliding head on with a 
gentleman in a pick-up truck Both vehicles were estimated to have been going 
70+ miles per hour .I immediately ran to the ladys car first.The driver was 
tangled in a mass of steel with one arm severed from what I could see at the 
time. I tore off a piece of a shirt and tied off the arteries. The car then 
started on fire. I rushed over to the truck and found a fire extinquisher in 
the back. I then put out the fire, but ther was just barely enough chemicals 
.If the fire had re-started there was nothing I coul have done. I then 
proceeded to remove the passenger from the car due to the possibility of the 
fire.I could not remove her from the car as she was pinned under the dash 
and the door was jammed. The driver was finally removed from the car when 
paramedics arrived and she was severed below the waist.There is a lot more 
incidents that occured,but I will get back to the purpose of telling the 
story.This was actually quite tramatic to me and even I am amased at how 
calmley I reacted.When I returned home to my spouse to be and told her of 
the story I was devistated by her response.She stated"See,that is how 
thoughtless you are.You don't stop to think about me or my children.What if 
one of those women would have had aids and you bring that home to me and my 
kids." I was speachless. Things worsened over the next year or so until I 
decided I had to get out.,but I was still curious as to why she acted with 
such unusual behavior.In my search for answers Iwent to a computer that was 
given to her by her "surrogate mother".It had burnt up about a year prior 
but when I contacted the computer tech he still had the system.I asked if he 
could reove the hard-drive ,out it in another system and see if there was 
anything that could help me to understand my situation. When he inserted the 
hard-drive he found most of what had been there was deleted. He then 
undeleted the hard-drive to find,at my amasement again,30,000 pictures of 
pornography.Everything you could possibly imagine from children to 
beasteality and everything in between.This woman is 62 years old,and lives 
alone with her husband of about same age ,except for every other weekend 
they keep the three children belonging to  what was to be my wife.I took 
this information to the mother of the children and that is where my 
nightmare began with her,the judicial system and the law. As soon as I told 
her of this woman having the pornography she went out and filed a domestic 
violence order against me.Since the filing she has managed to have me 
arrested twice,spend over$ 80,000 in attorney fees for ,what in actuality 
was her stalking me.When I was in the court ,facing these issues and at the 
same time trying to convince the Judge (by me I mean my counsel) what was 
really happening,including me having at the hearing witnesses that could 
verify everything Iwas saying and heard from her own mouth a different story 
than what she told the judge,the judge refused to let ANY of my witnesses 
speak.All of my witnesses were very respected people,I.E.,a 30 year state 
prosecutor,A captain on the police dept,a probation officer for the 
state,ect.,all of which knew the truth about this woman and were to testify 
on my behalf. The judge looks at the woman and asks"are you afraid for your 
life" to which she applies "yes" and he concluded the hearing,not allowing 
anyone to speak on my behalf.I feel by the existence of the porn and other 
things I have seen in the older couples residence ,the children are most 
likely being sodomized and the mother is aware of it.When I went to the 
police dept with the information ,they would do nothing stating there was a 
problem due to  "chain of command".I then understand by my own 
counsel,should I try and pursue the authorities with this information of 
pornography and very possible child abuse,that I would likely be charged by 
the judge, who issued the order,with a contempt charge of 
harrasement.Unbeleivable system...Sadly neglected children. To anyone 
reading this is there any recourse through a higher power than the court to 
get free from this woman and  help the children,although I have been told 
they are not my problem.I can't help but feel for them They are 9 years 
old.2boys and a girl.         jwconti@cox.net

Dear governor how can you not intervene in a criminal matter something that is so unconsionable, if the governor can't protect it's own citizens and tries to pass this terrible ordeal that my father and I have been thru. Mr governor I was drugged and operated on, they operated on my eyes, nose, ears, vocal chords, my optic nerve, they took muscles a kidney worst of all they inserted a pace maker, so they can electrocute me, my cars my motorcycle my apartment were all rigged to put out high voltage of eletricity, Mr Bush this has nothing to do with the court system for now, these are some of the people involved my cousin James Khawly, Bernard Mevs, who happens to own all the Publix supermarkets,and is very well connected to the white house.If I should die governor Bush even by natural causes that would be considered murder.When there are crimes commited law enforcement investigates and then the court system gets involved, for 7 years I have been trying to get law enforcement involved,I have been to the FBI on 3 occassions and since there is an FBI agent in the family Marc Peters they have covered up for him.My father left me an estate worth over 1 million dollars and I have not been able to get a dime I had $8,000 dollars in an account at Wachovia and they just took my money and they had the audacity to say I commited fraud, If I should die governor I hope you can live with yourself.

Estimados Seores,

Me dirigo a ustedes para oponerme a la ejecucin de ngel Nieves Daz, e indicar todas las seales que ponen en duda su capacidad para ser juzgado y para representarse a s mismo.

Primero, quiero manifestar mi apoyo a la familia de Joseph Nagy, asesinado en 1979, y dejar claro que no pretendo restar importancia a la gravedad de este crimen ni del sufrimiento que ha causado.

Hay una gran disparidad de las condenas en este caso, en el que un acusado ha recibido una pena de cadena perpetua y el otro una condena de muerte, pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quin fue el autor de los disparos.

Siento una gran preocupacin por el uso contra ngel Daz del testimonio de un informador encarcelado, que es un tipo de testimonio notoriamente poco fiable.

Les recuerdo que cuatro de los miembros del jurado no votaron a favor de la pena de muerte.

Sealo que una reciente investigacin ha detectado serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos la existencia de disparidades geogrficas y raciales y el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad en el jurado para imponer la pena.

Por estas razones pido al gobernador que intervenga para detener esta ejecucin.

Dear Sirs,

I m writing to you to oppose the execution of ngel Nieves Daz, based on a number of facts which cast doubt on his capacity to represent himself, and the fairness of his trial.

First of all I would like to manifest my support for the family of Joseph Nagy, killed in 1979, and explain that in no way do I mean to belittle the gravity of the crime committed, nor of the suffering it has caused. 

There is, however, considerable disparity in this case, in which one of the accused has been condemned to death, while another has received a life sentence, despite the contradictory testimonies about who fired the shots. 

I feel extremely concerned about the use of a testimony from somebody in jail against ngel Daz, because history has shown that these types of testimonies are notoriously untrustworthy.

I remind you also that four members of the jury did not vote in favour of the death sentence in this case. 

I also draw your attention to the fact that a recent investigation has identified serious problems in the system of the application of the death penalty in Florida, amongst which figure the geographic and racial disparities, and the fact that a unanimous decision by the jury is not required to impose the death penalty. 

For the above reasons I ask the governor to intervene and prevent the death penalty in this case.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I am writing to you on behalf of my ten year old grandson, Tyler Morris Causey who lives in Port Orange. He is presently staying with his other Grandmother, Jennifer Petteway. Tyler's mother has been arrested several times on prescription fraud and other charges. She is now in Volusia County Branch Jail. I believe she has 7 counts on her. On November 24 of this year, there was an article in the local newspaper about her. She has posted bail the other times she has been in jail, but this time she has been in there approximately 2 weeks. We do not know at this point what her punishment will be nor do we know if and how long it will take her to get her life back on track once she has served her sentence.
 
I am writing this because of my concern about Tyler. His other grandmother has been keeping him and has had him a good portion of his life while the mother has worked, etc.  My son, Ben Causey, lives here in Mississippi and would like for Tyler to come live with him. I believe he needs his father. Tyler's mother, Stephanie Marie Campe, believes she can make the decision about where Tyler lives. His grandmother in Port Orange has stated to me that she is "exhausted and about to have a breakdown".  My son is willing and happy to have his son come live with him.  However, we have no papers saying that he will be under my son's custody. Stephanie knows that we need the paper to get him enrolled in school here and also to get medical help. She has expressed to her mother that she probably won' t sign anything. Tyler usually comes to Mississippi for Christmas, however, we are trying to get some paperwork done before he flies here so there will be no concern with kidnaping.
 
The social worker there is Mrs. Brown. She has not returned Jennifer's(grandmother) call. I felt like she would know what needs to be done. Even if Stephanie served no sentence, she will not be ready to have Tyler back. I am hoping that you can help us with this matter. My son's attorney is drawing up papers now. We do not want Tyler going to a foster home since he has a loving father and family here. His grandmother there states that she will sign papers saying Tyler needs to be with his father. 
 
Anything you can do to help will be greatly appreciated.
Tyler's mother is Stephanie Marie Campe, DOB 9/20/78. Her booking number is ws660989.

                                            Sincerely,

Lo unico que le puedo decir es que Nuestro Dios jamas lo abandone, ni a usted ni a sus familias, hoy sufren unos nios, unos hijos, unos nietos, unos hermanos, una isla Puerto Rico, Dios no permita jamas y de corazon se lo digo, que no tenga que pasar por eso jamas. Sr. Gobernador Jeb Bush, yo lo respetaba por que reflejaba un ser humano excepcional, pero hoy me llevo en el alma una gran desilucion. Dios lo bendiga y que lo llene de paz y que reflexione que hizo algo que no le pertenecia hacer. Le deseo una muy feliz Navidad y que en su corazon nazca nuevamente Nuestro Seor Jesus, para que calme su conciencia. Mil bendiciones

Estimado seor Gobernador:
 
Le escribe Rolando Melendez Martnez, referente al caso de pena de muerte del Sr. ngel Nieves Daz. Se que es muy tarde porque ya la ejecucin se efectu,  pero le queremos indicar que los puertorriqueos nos encontramos en contra a la pena de muerte.  Creo que se debe abrir la puerta del dialogo con la comunidad hispana. Soy Legislador Municipal de la Ciudad de Bayamn Puerto Rico.  Pertenesco al Partido Nuevo Progresista y soy Republicano.  Pero esto no quiere decir que podemos aplaudir este tipo de actos.  Para este tipo de delito recomendamos cadena perpetua y no la muerte.  No quiero justificar el delito del seor Angel pero creo que usted debi contestar las distintas cartas que se le enviaron, por el Gobernador y el Presidente del Senado de Puerto Rico.  Quiero decirle que soy un joven de 24 aos y una persona activo en la poltica de Estados  Unidos.  Recomendaremos que los puertorriqueos no apoyen a ningn candidato a ningn puesto electivo que crea en la pena de muerte.  Solo le solicito que le explique a los puertorriqueos porque no pudo contestar las cartas. Espero que mis comentarios solo sirvan para consiensar de que la Pena de Muerte no hace cumplir a un delincuente porque con la muerte escapa de pagar por sus actos a diferencias de la cadena perpetua. 
 
 
Cordialmente

Qu lstima que haya permitido la ejecucin de Angel Nieves Daz !!!!
 
Es un horror ver cmo en un pas como Estados Unidos todava existan leyes que aprueben la pena capital.
 
Sr. Bush, no se ha puesto a pensar que con la pena capital no slo se sentencia a un reo, sino tambin a los familiares del mismo?
 
En estos momentos, usted debe de sentirse el peor de los verdugos pues no ha movido ni un dedo en favor de conmutarle la pena capital a Angel, y ahora la familia pasar la peor Navidad en sus vidas.!!!
No le bastaron todas las cartas y pedidos de clemencia de las diferentes autoridades puertorriqueas, ni de los distintos sectores tanto religiosos como de derechos humanos.
 
Acaso est enviando un mensaje subliminal a los hispanos y otra minoras residentes en la Florida ??
 
Estoy muy segura de que si el sentenciado hubiera sido algn familiar de alguien prominente tanto en el gobierno como en la sociedad en donde usted se desenvuelve, usted le hubiera conmutado la pena capital.....de eso no tengo la menor duda. !!!
 
Sabe, voy a orar mucho por usted, pues de ahora en adelante va a necesitar mucha paz interior debido al remordimiento de conciencia que tendr por el resto de sus das, porque con un acto como el que ha hecho no se puede vivir en paz y ms cuando el Seor Nieves siempre mantuvo que era inocente.
 
Cuntos reos no han sido ajusticiados incorrectamente slo porque las aparencias as los culpaban??
 
Usted deca en su comunicado al Gobernador de Puerto Rico Acevedo Vil que no le conmutara la pena capital al Seor Nieves porque el reo nunca tuvo ningn acto de remordimiento.
Pero, cmo usted pretende que lo hiciera si siempre mantuvo que era inocente ??
Yo nunca aceptara una culpa por algo que no he hecho !!!
 
A usted lo pensaba diferente a su hermano el Presidente George Bush pues siempre pens que usted era ms humano y que se senta muy identificado con los hispanos.
Tal parece que no es as y me d mucha lstima.!!!
 
Ya no podemos revivir a un difunto, pero usted llevar la culpa de inaccin por el resto de sus das. !!
 
Dios lo perdone !!!

Thank you for the reply.  I thought that I could not
take it to the court system, because the company
contract states that any dispute has to be arbitrated
right there in Florida.  Also, I thought that there was
a service for such matters, connected with the state's
attorney's office.  Which office deals with Home
Improvement complaints?  These interstate cases are
very inconvenient, after about five years, what could
one expect, "Their minds are made up, don't confuse
them with the facts."  Neither arbitration nor courts
were necessary, the office in Columbia had eye witnesses
but the contract office is in Tampa, Florida.  I will
and did not lose the case, no matter what they all did,
or did not do.  It is like one said:  Who won the
San Francisco earthquake?

Dear Governor, 

My name is Mildred Diaz a Florida Resident, actively pursing my education in the Criminal Justice field.  I'm a hard working single mother of 2 (ages 8 and 2), with only 23 years of life.  I'm not the most intelligent person and definitely not the best when it comes down to writing to an Honorable person as yourself, but here it goes. 

Yesterday, I receive a phone call from my mother to turn the news on and watch the case of Angel Nieves Diaz.  I must admit that to my surprise this was not the local news, it was the news in Puerto Rico.  I've been going around in circles trying to find the logic in this case.  I've read a few articles on the media and correct me if I'm wrong, but this case is just bogus.  At only 1 hour from the execution of this individual which I don't know but believe his innocence is fact, how is it possible for a person not to receive an interpreter at trial when there is a language barrier.  That being said, where are our civil rights as United States Citizens?   

From what I have read in simple black in white, how is it possible for this person to be executed when the key prosecution witness at the trial in 1985 of Angel Nieves Diaz has recanted his testimony, which had been a key part of the evidence that convicted Angel Nieves Diaz of murder.  Due to the Judge refusing to provide the sworn affidavit that Ralph Gajus signed stating that his testimony was false, now we have an individual being sentenced to death for lack of communication, lack of judgement, flaws in the justice system, and lack of evidence.  How can we (citizens of the US) feel secure and safe with a justice system that instead of making justice, they're constantly committing injustice acts.  How many people have been proven innocent after having served many years and prison? 

The reason behind my anger is why would I want to continue to pursue my education in the Criminal Justice field if I myself don't believe the justice system is right. 

Why deny the right to live to a person that has been convicted with very few and petty evidence.  Why not rethink this whole scenario and reopen the case and let him prove his innocence, if that's what he says he is.   

Remember:   A person is always innocent until proven guilty and in this case that lacks evidence "How do we know he is not innocent"? 

I appreciate your time and hope you can do something for this individual, although, by the time you read this he might already be executed. 

Have a blessed day and Happy Holidays for you and your loved ones. 


Thank You,

Mildred Diaz

The most recent developments thru a t.v. interview that took place in 1984 reveal that Angel could had been the object of a set up by authorities for political/ideological reasons related to the Pro-Independence movement in P.R.. This newest factor in addition to the recantation by the witnesses who declared against him, are sufficient reasons to at least grant a suspension of his death. Please reconsider. This is Christmas time. If postponed, and later consummated, at least the effect on the Puerto Rican people will be diminished. Remember that besides for humanitarian reasons, for political reasons it is convenient to exclude all possible angles before reaffirming such a fatal decision. May God grant you the best Wisdom under the circumstances. Remember that it is not too late, you are only a phone call away. Gracias for your being humane. Angel Ruiz Rivera.

Mr. Bush,

I am writing to request that you Do Not Execute Angel Nieves Diaz.  There is simply no room for another senseless death in this world, especially a person who could be innocent.

How many times have people been found innocent after they have been executed?  
Angel Nieves Diaz could be the next one.  

There is no coming back from death.  Do Not Execute Angel Nieves Diaz.

My good friend Dr. Brad Timpf was recently murdered in the parking lot of a Houstons restaurant.  Even his cold blooded killer deserves a chance at life.

There is a possibility that Angel Nieves Diaz did not commit the crime that he is being accused of.  However slim that chance may be, it is too big a risk to put him to death without being sure of his guilt.

PLEASE Do Not Execute Angel Nieves Diaz.

Thanks and best regards,

Dear Governor,
I wish to appeal to you on behalf of Angel Nieves Diaz, who is due to be executed on dec. 13, 2006. My sympathies go out to the family and loved ones of Joseph Nagy, and I agree this was a very tragic event that cannot go unpunished. However, ending the life of the person who has been convicted is never a solution to the problem of crime facing our society ( particularly when there is strong evidence that Angel Nieves Diaz is innocent). 
It is my belief that Angel Nieves Diaz deserves a stay of execution on the basis of coerced testimony, the fact that he was allowed to represent himself despite a lack of knowledge of the law and a language barrier, and also because of the influencing of the jury through extensive security measures.
It is not too late to correct this miscarriadge of justice. There are simply too many questions regarding Mr. Diaz'sguilt. In view of he information mentionned above, I urge you to act quickly to correct this situation and spare Angel Diaz's life.
Thank you for your time and your consideration of this important and urgent matter.

If there is life, there is always the opportunity to change your mind and to retract from previous decisions.  We are in constant evolution and thinking diferently about an issue is honorable for you and others.

Angel Nieves is a man who has been incarcerated for 20 years. Killing him is not going to bring back the person who died, and is not going to stop people from killing other human beings.

Please reconsider your decision and let your heart to dictate what's the best decision to take.

Dear Governor!
I would like you to spare Angel Nieves Daz life.
First of all I want to show my sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy.
I don't want  to play down the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused. 
I'm against this execution because evidence is not clear and it is very likely that he is not 
the the man who shot Mr.Nagy.The man who probably shot him,Angel Toro,got a life
sentence but Angel Daz is getting death sentence.I can't see that it is fair.His crime was
robbing that shop of Mr.Nagy.I also want to question his competency to stand trial and
represent himself.
Ralph Gajus,a key prosecution witness at the trial has now recanted his testimony against 
Angel Daz.I therefor doubt the reliability of the jury's verdict and moreover 4 jurors did not
vote for the death sentence.Without the testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors would have
voted against the death sentence. 
Also I want to point out that recent research  has found serious problems with Florida's capital 
justice system,including geographic and racial disparities,and the lack of a requirement for
unanimity in jury sentencing decisions. 
Dear Governor,I would like you to intervene to stop this execution.

segn mi modo de ver la ejecucin de ngel Nieves Daz no es 
una solucin pues:

1.- Son diversas las seales que ponen en duda su capacidad 
para ser juzgado y para representarse a s mismo. 

2.- Creo que se ha concurrido en una disparidad de condenas en 
este caso, pues uno de los acusados ha recibido una pena de 
cadena perpetua y el otro una condena a muerte, pese a los 
testimonios contradictorios sobre quin fue el autor de los 
disparos.

3.- Supongo que su experiencia como conocedor del sistema 
judicial americano le ha demostrado en ms de una ocasin que 
el uso de un informador encarcelado como testimonio es poco 
fiable.

4.- Cuatro de los miembros del jurado no votaron a favor de la 
pena de muerte. 

5.- Una reciente investigacin ha detectado serios problemas 
en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en su estado 
(Florida): la existencia de disparidades geogrficas, raciales 
y el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad para imponer la 
pena.

Le ruego que intervenga para detener esta ejecucin. En el 
caso que mi carta llegue ya tarde le pido humildemente que 
tenga en cuenta mis razones en otros casos similares y que 
todo ello lleve a una reflexin social en su pas y la futura 
abolicin de esta pena capital.

Atentamente.

Estimado Sr. Gobernador el Estado de la Florida, USA.:
 
Con esta comunicacin quiero expresar lo siguiente en torno al caso del Sr. Angel Nieves Diaz.
 
Quiero exponer:
 
1.  Mi apoyo a la familia de Joseph Nagy, asesinado en 1979, y aclaro que no pretendo restar importancia a la gravedad de este crimen ni al sufrimiento que ha causado.
 
2.  ME OPONGO TERMINANTEMENTE a la ejecucin de ngel Nieves Daz, debido todas las seales que ponen en duda su capacidad para ser juzgado y para representarse a s mismo.
 
3. Sealo la disparidad de las condenas en este caso, en el que un acusado ha recibido una pena de cadena perpetua y el otro una condena de muerte, pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quin fue el autor de los disparos.
 
4.  Sealo que Ralph Gajus, testigo de cargo fundamental en el juicio, se ha retractado de su testimonio contra ngel Daz, lo que pone an ms en duda la fiabilidad del veredicto emitido por el jurado.
 
5.  Sealo que cuatro de los miembros del jurado no votaron a favor de la pena de muerte, lo que indica una posible duda residual en su mente sobre la culpabilidad del acusado y sugiere que, sin el testimonio de Ralph Gajus, es posible que ms miembros del jurado hubieran votado contra la condena de muerte.
 
6.  Sealo adems que una reciente investigacin ha detectado serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos la existencia de disparidades geogrficas y raciales y el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad en el jurado para imponer la pena.
 
7.  Por estos motivos pido al Honorable Gobernador del Estado de la Florida, clemencia para Angel Nieves Diaz.
 
 
Que Dios todopodereoso ilumine sus almas y corazones y no permitan que el hombre interprete la justicia tomando en sus manos una vida por otra vida.
 
Dios les Bendiga!

Asunto: RE: URGENT ACTION



  

Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush about a death row inmate.  The Governor appreciates your concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.

 

Governor Bush believes that the death penalty is appropriate and warranted in certain capital murder cases, and supports its use by the courts in those cases.  The Governor also believes we should look not only to the issues surrounding the defendant, but also to the surviving victims, and to the effect the murder has on our community as a whole, in deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment.

 

Florida law provides numerous levels of appeals for the convicted individual before the sentence is moved.  Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.  No other state has invested the public resources in capital post conviction legal representation that Florida has been providing for well over a decade. 

 

Governor Bush shares the concerns of many that the death penalty must be reserved for only the most heinous cases.  As the Governor has said many times, the signing of a death warrant is one of the most solemn and somber responsibilities he must undertake, and he does so with humble deliberation.

 

Again, thank you for taking the time to write about this very serious issue.

 

Sincerely,

 

Warren Davis

Office of Citizens Services

Subject:	Piedad Sr. Jeb Bush          (reenvo)

Honorable Jeb Bush:
    
    Por este medio me dirijo a usted, muy respetuosamente,  para apelar  a la fibra ms fina y tierna de su noble corazn. Para pedirle,  con todas las fuerzas de mi espritu,  que tenga misericordia por la vida del puertorriqueo Angel Nieves Daz .  Urge la posposicin de su ejecucin y la celebracin de un nuevo y justo jucio. 
 
    Este hombre, desde  que lo apresaron hace ms de veinte aos , viene dicindole al mundo y especialmente a ustedes, los que tienen la vida de l en sus manos,  que es inocente .  Desde hace muchos aos lo he visto en diferentes reportajes televisivos, aqu en Puerto Rico, en los cuales se reafirma que no asesin al gerente de una barra all en Florida.  Caso por el cual se le acus y cumple crcel. 
 
    Yo tena tambin mis dudas con respecto a si l era culpable o no, ya que  los delicuentes asesinos dicen ser inocentes cuando los arrestan y los meten presos.  Pero cuando esta maana prend mi computadora y le un reportaje donde su ex-compaero de celda dice que l minti en el juicio en contra de Angel Nieves Daz diciendo que ste le dijo que l fue  el que mat al gerente de la barra sin ser cierto,  mi alma se  angusti al pensar que por esa mentira un inocente maana va a ser ejecutado.  
 
    Estoy  totalmente de acuerdo que a las personas que fra y viciosamente le quitan la vida a otro ser humano, se lebe encancerlar, derretir la llave y tirar los residuos de sta al fondo del mar para que jams salga .  Esto siempre y cuando se le pruebe, fuera de toda duda razonable, que s lo hizo y no que otro lo acuse por salvarse de la crcel  o por maldad. 
 
    Pngase en el lugar de la familia de este reo.  Si despus de un hijo suyo u otro ser querido haber cumplido ms de veinte aos de crcel , apareciera una persona que declar en contrar de su familar y a horas de que lo maten, su conciencia no lo deje vivir tranquilo y diga que minti cuando lo acus de asesinato  No buscara usted hasta debajo de las piedras la forma de detener su ejecucin?  Si lo hara y lo lograra por ser una persona poderosa .  Pero como se trata de personas pobres nadie los escucha.  
 
     Para colmo, no mataran slo al reo,  mataran  la Familia Nives Daz completa.  No fsicamente, si no por dentro, ya que la ejecucin sera cerca del Da de Navidad.  Da en que naci el nio Jess. Cada ao en esta poca en vez de celebrarla slo le costara  llorar a su ser querido.  Se imagina usted en esta situacin tan dif cil y dolorosa en plena navidad  y
que luego resulte que su familiar era inocente?
 
    Al escribirle este correo electrnico libero mi conciencia.  Si con ste lograra conmover su corazn, fuera la mujer ms feliz de este planeta. Si de lo contrario no lo logro,  cumpl con lo que mi corazn y mi razn me dictaron.  Y esto fue que le escribiera a usted e intercediera por Angel.  Lo hice as por que tenemos las experiencia de otros dos puertorriqueos que estuvieron presos por asesinato. Gracias a Dios,  a ltima hora aparecieron pruebas que lo exoneraban.  Uno cumpli 18 aos de crcel y  el otro menos aos.  Que conste, no  abogo por l  por ser puertorriqueo.  Igualmente lo hara por otra persona, sin importar su nacionalidad, si se encontrara en estas mismas  circumstacias. 
 
    Sr. Jeb Bush: Le pido ante Dios que recapacite.  Que el nio Jess renazca en el pesebre de su corazn. Que lo gue a repensar su decisin de no celebrarle un nuevo y justo juicio a Angel; en el cual la persona que lo acus de asesinato y que ahora dice que ste no lo hizo, lo puedan escuchar e interrogar  nuevamente hasta encontrar la verdad. Y si l, aunque no la haya matado, estuvo envuelto en el mismo que cumpla el tiempo que le falte o si ya cumpli lo que tena que cumplir, que salga libre.
 
     Esperando su atencin al respecto, queda  
 
Cordialmente y con el corazn destrozado,
 
Sandra Ortiz

Honrorable Gobernador Jeb Bush:
En esta manana senti la inquietud y la preocupacion a tal punto que deje 
todos los queaceres del hogar para escribirle esta humilde carta.  
Pertenesco a la iglesia methodista y como creyente no puedo opinar a favor 
de la ejecucion del Sr. Angel Nieves Diaz.  Las noticias indican que el Sr. 
Nieves acepta de que cometio un crimen en Puerto Rico.  Sin embargo, este no 
fue el crimen que lo condena a la pena capital.  En una ocacion despues de 
las navidades para ser exacto un 2 de enero hiba a una actividad de la 
iglesia.  En el camino presencie como como un individuo apunalaba a otro en 
la ciudad de Chicago.  Yo estaba con mi actual Pastor y pudimos separarlos.  
Inmediatamente llamamos a la policia y la policia dijo que si queriamos ser 
testigos de lo ocurrido.  !Que sorpresa!  Nos enserraron a mi y al pastor 
porque habia que esperar por los detectives.  Nos trataron como si fueramos 
nosotros los delincuentes y hasta nos dijeron que teniamos derecho a un 
abogado.  Nos dejaron ir despues de largas horas.  Con esto voy a terminar.  
Pudimos ser victimas del sistema y gracias a Dios no paso nada.  Pero, que 
tal de aquellos que no tuvieron la misma suerte y son presos inocentes.  
!Por favor pare esta muerte!  Ojala que esta carta llegue a tiempo y lo 
conmueva.
May God Bless You!

Subject:	Angel Diaz Clemency

 Dear Governor Bush,
 
Please use your lawful Executive Clemency process to commute the sentence of Angel Nieves Diaz to life in prison.  
 
The killing of Joseph Nagy was a tragedy.  The needless killing of yet another man is also a tragedy.  I have lost a loved one to murder and know the heartache of such a loss.  Nothing can be gained by the killing of someone already locked up in prison.  
 
The Governor says he is concerned about the effect that murder has on our community.  The uneccessary killing of an already locked up prisoner also has an effect on our community.  It simply teaches that killing out of anger and vengeance is acceptable, even praiseworthy.  The people of Florida look to you for guidance.  What better legacy to leave than one of the power of mercy, not the horror of needless homicide?
 
Christmas is the absolute worst time to subject the citizens of our great state to the "somber and solemn" spectacle of the uneccessary killing of a captive prisoner.  Jesus was an executed prisoner whose sentence was carried out on authority of the governor of Palestine.  In 2000 years, what have we learned?
 
Sincerely,

Just think a moment of what Jesus would do.  We all have failed Jesus once in our life, and he has always been there to forgive us no matter what we do or how bad it is.  Even at the last minute, when he was ready to be crucified he asked his Father to forgive us.
 
I humbly beg that you please forgive this man.  You have now an opportunity to be like Jesus and sow a seed torwards your future.  If you forgive him, whenever you need mercy you will get mercy for you and your family.  
 
I don't know this man, but my family and I have cried and begged the Lord to forgive him.  Please, please don't let him be killed which is what he has been condemned for.  
 
We will be eternally grateful to you and will pray for you.  God bless you and your family.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

Please put a stop to the death penalty. Sir, I am a firm believer that a criminal should pay for what he/she has done with confinenment. A person that kills someone should be put away for ever and should not have any rights. But how can you justify legally killing a human being? Who will pay for that death? The person that insert the needles and then activate the levels for the poison to enter that human body? Or should it be the members of the jury that sentenced them to die? Or the prosecutors that asked for the death penalty? You have the power to change the way we live and think! As a human being I am begging you to do all possible to change this way of thinking. You could start with Angel Diaz. 

Thank you for your time,

With much respect,

Dear Governor:

 

I am writing to you on matter of great concerned to many people in the international community and in our own country.  It is concerning the scheduled execution of Angel Nieves Diaz on December 13, 2006 the murders of Joseph Nagy in Miami.    My sympathy goes to the family and friends of Joseph Nagy.  In no manner do I excuse their death or to minimize the suffering it has caused.

 

I am opposed to his execution on the evidence which calls in to question his competency to stand trial and represent himself.  There is a disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman.

 

Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, ahs now recanted his testimony against Angel Diaz, calling into further doubt the reliability of the jurys verdict.  Four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty indicating a possible residential doubt in their minds about the defendants guilt. It suggests that without the testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence.  Recent research has found serious problems with Floridas capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and lacks a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions.

 

I call on you to intervene to stop this execution.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. 

 

Sincerely,

John J. Ahearn

Al igual que miles de puertorriqueos, no estoy de acuerdo con la pena de muerte para el o para cualquier otra persona. Inclusive, esta escrito en la constitucin de Puerto Rico. Al leer todo el artculo publicado en los diferentes medios se puede llegar claramente a la conclusin de que hubo fallas en el proceso judicial que se llevo a cabo. No hay que ser abogado ni tener un alto grado de educacin para analizar todas estas fallas las cuales quieren obviarse en estos momentos; ya sean por razones polticas, raciales o por el mero hecho de no dar el brazo a torcer. Que es peor, tener que lamentarse cuando finalmente se pruebe que el es inocente o el no actuar de inmediato y proveerle un nuevo juicio y la oportunidad de vivir? Solo espero que Dios lo ilumine y le de mucha sabidura para que usted pueda reanalizar este caso en sus meritos. Miles de personas en todo el mundo se lo agradeceran.

Dear Mr. Davis,
Thank you so much for answering my letter I sent regarding a Florida citizen
who is on death row.  While I have considered Governor Bush's position on
the death sentence of this individual and I understand that some kind of
justice must be done, I would like to remind him that it makes no sense to
put someone's life to an end because this person did the same thing to someone
else.  I would like to ask him to sit and think a while longer and his heart
will surely tell him what is truly right or wrong.  Although heinous as it
may seem or even be, ALL forms of life are sacred.  I would like Gov. Bush
to please keep that in mind every time he has a death sentence to sign.

Dear Governor, 


Reportedly, 

      Mr Angel Nieves Diaz, aged 55,

is scheduled for execution in Florida on 13 December 2006. He was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder, during a robbery, of bar manager Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979. 

I want to express my sympathy for the family of Mr Nagy and I am not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused. 

However, I oppose the execution of Mr Angel Nieves Diaz, as his competency to stand trial and represent himself must be called into question. There is a striking disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman. Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against Angel Diaz; this calls into further doubt the reliability of the jury's verdict. I must note that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty, indicating a possible residual doubt in their minds about the defendant's guilt; this lets me suggest that without the testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence. 

Furthermore, I want to call your attention to the fact that recent research has found serious problems with Florida's capital justice system, including geographical and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions. It is to be noted that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty. 

Dear Governor, please intervene to stop this execution. 


Respectfully,

 

           Danny Joe Viera Otero

A l'attention de Monsieur le Gouverneur de la Floride


Monsieur, je viens d'apprendre l'excution imminente de d'Angel Nieves Diaz 
contre laquelle je voudrais exprimer mon opposition.
S'il est vrai qu'une famille souffre du crime commis contred Joseph Nagy 
depuis 1979, il n'en est pas moins vrai qu' Angel Nieves Diaz n'a pas eu et 
pu assurer lui-mme sa dfense pour le crime qui le conduit aujourd'hui  la 
peine de mort.
En effet, la violence et les problmes mentaux dont a t victime Angel Diaz 
dans son enfance, ainsi que sa toxicomanie  partir de lge de seize ans, 
ont t voqus lors des audiences qui ont suivi la reconnaissance de 
culpabilit.
De plus, Angel Toro a plaid coupable de meurtre sans circonstances 
aggravantes, en change dune condamnation  la rclusion  perptuit. 
Lancienne petite amie dAngel Diaz a dclar sous serment que le soir des 
faits il lui avait dit quAngel Toro avait abattu un homme pendant le 
cambriolage. La dposition de deux autres tmoins, qui taient dans le bar 
au moment du vol, indiquait quAngel Diaz ntait pas le tueur. Cependant, 
Ralph Gajus, un dtenu informateur ayant partag la cellule dAngel Diaz, 
avait dclar que, lorsquils taient dans la mme cellule, Angel Diaz lui 
avait dit quil avait abattu Joseph Nagy. Ralph Gajus a maintenant fourni 
une dclaration sous serment dans laquelle il affirme que son tmoignage 
lors du procs tait faux ; quAngel Diaz ne lui a jamais dit quil tait le 
tueur, et quil ne savait pas daprs les changes quil avait eus avec 
Angel Diaz qui avait abattu Joseph Nagy.  Il affirme galement dans cette 
dclaration que son faux tmoignage tait motiv par de la colre  lgard 
dAngel Diaz et le dsir de sattirer les faveurs de ltat quant  
l'accusation de meurtre dont il faisait lui-mme l'objet.  Ralph Gajus avait 
dclar au procs quon ne lui avait rien promis en change de son 
tmoignage.  Cependant, lors de la dtermination de la peine  infliger  
Ralph Gajus, un policier avait fait tat de laide que celui-ci avait 
fournie  laccusation dans laffaire Diaz. Pendant les dlibrations du 
jury lors du procs dAngel Diaz, les jurs avaient demand une copie du 
tmoignage de Ralph Gajus, mais le juge avait refus et donn pour 
instruction aux jurs de se fonder sur ce dont ils se souvenaient. Le jury a 
prononc un verdict de culpabilit.  Le fait que Ralph Gajus soit revenu sur 
son tmoignage remet encore plus en question le bien-fond de cette dcision 
du jury. Lors de laudience consacre  la dtermination de la peine, des 
arguments en faveur dune rduction de peine avaient t avancs en 
invoquant le fait quAngel Diaz avait t uniquement complice du crime, sans 
toutefois que des preuves  lappui de cette affirmation ne soient 
prsentes.
Enfin, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort, 
ce qui pouvait indiquer qu'il subsistait dans leur esprit un doute quant  
la culpabilit de l'accus, et que sans le tmoignage de Ralph Gajus, les 
jurs auraient peut-tre t plus nombreux  voter contre la peine de mort ;
Je vous rappelle pour finir que des recherches menes aux tats-Unis ont 
montr que le fait quun doute subsiste quant  la culpabilit dun condamn 
incitait fortement les jurs  prononcer une peine moins lourde dans les 
affaires o la peine de mort pouvait tre prononce.

Au nom de ce doute qui subsiste encore aujourd'hui, j'en appelle  votre 
sens de la justice et  votre humanit pour empcher cette sentence du 13 
dcembre.

Subject:	Scheduled Execution of Angel Nieves Diaz

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush:

 

As Co-Executives of Global Ministries, the missionary unit of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ, we write to request your intervention and clemency in the case of Angel Nieves Daz who has been sentenced to death by the State of Florida and whose execution is set for December 13, 2006.  As people of faith we believe that all life is sacred and that compassion for life does not negate the need to be accountable for violent crimes.  We believe that capital punishment does not abolish crime but rather feeds into the already present cycle of violence affecting our society.

 

Mr. Nieves Daz was convicted for the murder of Joseph Nagy and has been imprisoned for over 20 years.  While we have sympathy for the family of Mr. Nagy, we do not believe Mr. Nieves death will be just retribution for his loss.  In addition, our partner in mission, Amnesty International, has been brought to our attention that this execution may take place in spite of growing national concern about the numerous problems associated with the administration of the death penalty.  This execution is scheduled at a time when other groups such as the American Bar Association (ABA) are raising significant questions about the fairness of Floridas death penalty system.  

 

Recently, a blue-ribbon assessment panel appointed by the ABA revealed that Floridas capital punishment policies fail to meet basic standards of fairness and justice.  The nine-member assessment team concluded that the state does not provide adequate safeguards to prevent the execution of an innocent person; 22 people have been released from death row in Florida due to evidence of their wrongful conviction. 

 

It is deeply unsettling that this execution would proceed while Floridas capital justice system remains mired in geographic and racial disparities. Florida is also the only state in the country that does not require a jury to be unanimous in recommending the death penalty.  In this case, it should be noted that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty.

 

We humbly request that you demonstrate your respect for justice and human life by doing everything in your power to stop the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz.  Thank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.

 

Respectfully in Christ

I am writing this email as a mother. 

My daughter, who is the second chair in Angel Diaz's
defense was born May 26th., 1979. That was the day
that the first men, John Spinkalink (Spelling?) was
executed. Ironically, she became an attorney with
Capital Collateral. I'm her mother and know how she
was worked night and day without a rest for more than
a month. 

That's not the only reason I am sending you this
email. I am writing It's not that I believe that in
our post modern era, capital punishment is cruel and
unusual punishment. I am writing this because probably
the trigger man will be watching the execution and
might even go free one day. 

If the Supreme Court doesn't stay this execution, you
are the only person who can stop this. Please Governor
Bush, please reconsider the punishment for this case.
I realize that this is not new information and that
the jury was aware of the facts. However, anyone who
has some knowledge of the law knows how unreliable
jailhouse testimony is. 

If your staff presents  you with this email, I am
honored that you are reading it and I thank you for 
your time.

Joseph Nagy can't be brought back to life but  we  as a society must
stop the entanglement of revenge and the illusion that one must take a
life in order to defend it. 
Govenor, as a Catholic you are aware of our former Pope's statement
John Paul II  "A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the
dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the case of
some one who has donegreat evil.  Modern societyhas the means of
protecting itself, withoutdefinitivelydenyong criminals a chance to
reform.I renew the appealI made recently at Christmas for a consensus
to end the death penalty, which is both cruel andunnecessary."

Stay the execution of Angel Diaz.  He must not die by our hands. Our
State needs a moretorium on the death penalty and you have the
political ability to do it. Raise the issue before you leave office.

Subject:	Angel Nieves Diaz

Dear Governor, 




I wish to appeal to you on behalf of ANGEL NIEVES DIAZ, who is due to be executed on Dec. 13, 2006.  My sympathies go out to the family and loved ones of Joseph Nagy, and I agree this was a very tragic event that cannot go unpunished. However, ending the life of the person who has been convicted is never a solution to the problem of crime facing our society (particularly when there is strong evidence that ANGEL NIEVES DIAZ is innocent). 

Mr. Diaz maintains that he was with his girlfriend in Connecticut the night of the shootings and did not learn of they until three days after they it had taken place.  This girlfriend ultimately testified against Diaz, but only after the police coerced her through the threat of drug charges.  At a post-conviction hearing, she admitted that she had lied. Mr. Diaz was offered a plea bargain, but chose to proceed with the trial, claiming 
innocence.  His cellmate and alleged co-conspirator Angel Toro also testified against Diaz.  Mr. Toro received a life sentence for his testimony. 

This disparity in the sentences handed out to the co-defendents highlights further irregularities in this case.  It may be noted that these disparities have taken place despite the uncertainty of who fired the fatal shot. 

Yet another questionable testimony against Mr. Diaz is that of Ralph Gajus, a prison informer, who admitted that his testimony against Angel Diaz was false and motivated by anger against the defendent.  Furthermore, he stated that he was not told who fired the fatal shot and remains unaware of the facts to this day.  The closeness of the jury's vote (a final outcome of 8 votes to 4), which took Mr. Gajus' testimony into account, suggests that a different outcome could very possibly have come about if Mr. Gajus had not given his false testimony. 

It is my belief that Angel Nieves Diaz deserves a stay of execution on the basis of coerced testimony, the fact that he was allowed to represent himself despite a lack of knowledge of the law and a language barrier, and also because of the influencing of the jury through extensive security measures. 

It is not too late to correct this miscarriage of justice.  There are simply too many questions regarding Mr. Diaz's guilt.  In view of the information mentioned above, I urge you to act quickly to correct this situation and spare Angel Diaz's life. 

Thank you for your time and your consideration of this important and urgent  matter.

Monsieur le Gouverneur BUSH,

 

Informe par Amnesty International de la situation dAngel Nieves DIAZ dont lexcution est imminente, je tenais  vous faire part de ma compassion pour la famille et les proches de Joseph NAGY. En aucun cas, je ne cherche  excuser le crime qui lui a cot la vie et ni  minimiser les souffrances quAngel Nieves DIAZ a engendres.

 

Cependant, je me dclare oppose  lexcution dAngel Nieves DIAZ car il existe de solides lments remettent en question son aptitude  tre jug et  assumer lui-mme sa dfense.

Je me permets de vous souligner de la disparit des peines infliges dans cette affaire, o un accus a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit et lautre  la peine de mort malgr la prsence de preuves contradictoires quand  qui a tir le coup mortel.

 

Je tiens aussi  souligner que Ralph Gajus, tmoin cl de laccusation dans cette affaire est maintenant revenu sur son tmoignage  lencontre dAngel DIAZ, remettant ainsi encore plus en cause la fiabilit de la dcision du jury.

 

Je vous rappelle que quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort, ce qui pouvait indiquer qu'il subsistait dans leur esprit un doute quant  la culpabilit de l'accus, et que sans le tmoignage de Ralph Gajus, les jurs auraient peut-tre t plus nombreux  voter contre la peine de mort.

 

Enfin, je me permets de vous faire remarquer quune tude rcente a mis au jour de graves problmes en ce qui concerne le systme dapplication de la peine capitale en Floride tels que les disparits raciales et gographiques dans lapplication de ce chtiment et le fait que lunanimit du jury nest pas requise pour la dtermination de la peine. 

 

Dans ce contexte, je vous demande donc, Monsieur le Gouverneur BUSH  de bien vouloir empcher lexcution dAngel Nieves DIAZ.

 

En esprant vivement que vous tiendrez compte des arguments avancs, je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma haute considration.

Encara la familia un suspenso supremo

Por Jos A. Delgado / Enviado Especial

Confirma que no hay decisin an un vocero
del mximo foro judicial. 

RAIFORD, Florida - El Tribunal Supremo de Estados Unidos mantena
an en vilo a la familia del prisionero boricua ngel Nieves
Daz, quien puede ser ejecutado esta noche como consecuencia de su
condena por un caso de asesinato.
No hay decisin an, manifest anoche
una portavoz del mximo foro judicial estadounidense, con base en
Washington, D.C.
La falta de decisin pudiera alimentar las esperanzas de la familia
de Nieves Daz, que ha acampado en un municipio aledao a la
prisin estatal de Florida, ubicada en la localidad de Raiford, que
tiene slo cerca de 200 habitantes.
Pudiera dar esperanzas. Pero, hay ocasiones en que el Tribunal
Supremo no se expresa y el caso se torna acadmico,
indic Osvaldo Burgos, director ejecutivo de la Comisin de
Derechos Civiles, quien anoche viajaba desde San Juan a esta zona para
acompaar a la familia.
La defensa de Nieves Daz elev el lunes un recurso de
certiorari ante el Supremo estadounidense como parte de sus ltimos
esfuerzos por conseguir aplazar o detener la ejecucin del
prisionero puertorriqueo.
En los ltimos das el Tribunal Supremo de Florida y el
Tribunal de Apelaciones del Undcimo Circuito, con base en Atlanta
(Georgia), rechazaron los argumentos de Nieves Daz en reclamo de
un aplazamiento de la sentencia de muerte o un nuevo proceso judicial.
Autoridades puertorriqueas "incluidos el gobernador
Anbal Acevedo Vil y el comisionado residente en Washington,
Luis Fortuo-, grupos pro derechos civiles y sectores religiosos
han reclamado sin xito al gobernador de Florida, Jeb Bush, para
que se detenga la ejecucin y a favor de una conmutacin de la
pena de muerte.
La primera dama de Puerto Rico, Luisa Gndara, solicit ayer
la intervencin de la primera dama de Florida, Columba Bush.
Como Primera Dama del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico,
respetuosamente, apelo a su sentido de compasin como nuestra
ltima esperanza de clemencia en nombre del puertorriqueo
ngel Nieves Daz, indic Gndara.
La Conferencia de Obispos Catlicos de Florida se uni
tambin recientemente a los pedidos de clemencia para Nieves
Daz. Al cumplir con esta orden de ejecucin, el
Estado le ensea a nuestros ciudadanos que matar a aquellos que han
matado a otro es aceptable, indica la carta que los obispos

Hola Sr. Bush
 
Este breve e-mail es una solicitud mas de clemencia para el reo Angel Nieves Diaz qien sera ejecutado este 13 de diciembre. Solo me baso en en esta peticion ya que pienso que aunque esta persona sea culpable de un asesinato la pena de muerte no es un castigo para el, esto mas bien es un castigo para su familia que no tienen culpa de lo que paso y son ellos los que van a sufrir mas la muerte de esa persona. Sin embargo me pareceria que el castigo justo para esta persona seria la cadena perpetua que pasara toda su vida en la carcel eso si seria el castigo justo para el. Por que ante la justicia de Dios igual de culpable e igual de asesino y de pecado es el por matar a otro ser humano que la persona que mande a matarlo a el igual de asesinos son. Y por otra parte si van a matar a esta persona por el matar a otro entonces deberian de matar a todas las personas que cometan un asesinato no les parece justo por que entonces unos si y otros no, no se vale. 
POR FAVOR CLEMENCIA PARA ANGEL NIEVES DIAZ.
PLEASE MERCY TO ANGEL NIEVES DIAZ.
Thank You 
Gracias Mil.

   Not at a meeting or a conference Sir, but within yourself.  Reflection, 
ponder, consider.... Remember that you are the ONLY person that can stop 
that execution from taking place. What is the authority of the  state of 
Florida doing  Mr. Governor Sir, exercising the "eye for an eye" that we 
call "The Law"?

   A life sentence or three life sentences, but.... kill or execute like you 
might say?  Mr. Governor, what message are we sending to the world? " If you 
do the crime, you do the time." I'm pretty sure we're all for that one. But 
time where, Governor? You're disposing of a human life and I'm sure you're 
not the person to do that. Authority gives you the power; but then again, 
because you ARE authority, it sure doesn't have to be that way. The life or 
what's left of it, of Mr. Angel Nieves Daz, is in your hands.

Subject:	Angel Nieves Diaz - Please don't kill him. Not in the name of this citizen.

Governor:  I add my voice to others who believe that you don't have to kill this guy - Angel Nieves Diaz - tomorrow to protect us citizens.  Commute his sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, if you must, but don't kill him.
 
It's wrong to kill people who kill people to teach people to not kill people.  Stop killing.
 
We are better than those we would kill for what they have done - even if there is no doubt about their guilt.
 
QUESTION:  Is there any chance whatsoever that this "killer" would be facing the death penalty if he were a multi-millionaire ?  Come on Jeb,  fess up.  You and I both know  that even if he were found guilty his life would be spared.  Tell me the last  time a person of limitless finances was executed in the USA ?  Leapold-Loeb ? O.J. Simpson ?

    Your father showed that he had a loving heart last week in Tallahassee.
Now, you have an opportunity to show your loving heart. Commute the death
sentence on Angel Diaz to life in prison.  There certainly are many judicial
doubts about his trial and mitigating circumstances about this life that

In  the name  of  humanity and  given  the many  questions relating  to  his  conviction I feel  that  commutation of  his  sentence would be  your  last  evidence  of  statesmanship. Stand  away from  the  political pressures surroundng death  sentences and  do  the  humane and  honorable act that  would  save  a  human  life. Death  sentences  have  not  reduced  the  incidence of  killings  in  our  state but  clearly statistics show  murder  rate has spiraled. Why  if  the  state kills  another  why can't the  citizens  have  the  same licence?

Subject:	Death Penatly of Mr. Angel Nieves Diaz

Dear Mr. Bush:

 

The capital punishment is the most extreme form of cruel pain, cruel or degrading. The capital punishment constitutes a violation of the right to the life.  The capital punishment is irreversible and involves the risk of which it executes innocents. It has not been possible to never demonstrate that the capital punishment has greater dissuasive effect front to the delinquency that other punishments.

 

If this is so then are not the relatives of a killer are allowed take mortal revenge on those that put their family member to death?  I wonder how is it fair? And to whom? First, the deceased has a family, perhaps dependents, and these are left harmed and un helped for the most part. There is no restitution by the killer. And the innocents who have lost a loved one must also bear their trauma and suffer its exacerbation through a trial and dealing with lawyers for God's sake. Then there are the dependents and family of the killer who have losses through no fault of their own. The victims pay, the society pays, the friends and family of the killer pays. The killer simply leaves this "veil of sorrow." So where is the equity in that arrangement?  In sum, is it fair to kill a killer? The answer is a resounding "NO". It is not fair to the victims, the relatives of the victims, the relatives of the guilty party, to the society as a whole. Nor, truth be told, is it fair to the killer. How can he or she regain the humanity they lost? How can they redeem themselves? How can they repair the damages done?

 

I am writing to you solely to asking you to concede amnesty for Mr. Angel Nieves Diaz is asking for his right to live.  Let him pay for the rest of his life  in jail of course. Is the right thing to do, is what we expect from a governor that believes in the peoples right to life. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. 

 

God be with you; I hope that this simple letter will help you make the right decision, you have the power to save a human life; do you have the will; I believe so.

 

Thanks for you time reading my email.

 

God bless you and your family

Dear Govenor,
 
I would like to beg of you to PLEASE STOP the execution of Angel Diaz who remains scheduled for execution in Florida on the 13th of December even though there is  new infomation.
 
I would like to express sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy, who was killed in 1979 and I do not believe that the crime was right  but I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE EXECUTION. I would like to note evidence that has been given calling into QUESTION THE COMPETENCY OF ANGEL DIAZ TO STAND TRIAL AND REPRESENT HIMSELF.  Also despite conflicting evidence on WHO WAS THE GUN MAN  Angel Diaz was sentenced to death. Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, HAS NOW RECANTED HIS TESTIMONY AGAINST ANGEL DIAZ, CALLING INTO FURTHER DOUBT THE RELIABILITY  OF THE JURY'S VERDICT. Further more four  jourors did NOT VOTE FOR THE DEATH PENALTY, indicating a possible residual doubt in their mind  sabout the defendant's guilt and also WITHOUT THE TESTIMONY OF Ralph Gajus MORE OF THE JURORS WOULD HAVE VOTED  AGAINST A DEATH SENTENCE.
 
Recent research has found SERIOUS PROBLEMS with Florida's  capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparitis, and the lack of requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions. 
So please, I beg of you Governor, TO INTERVENE AND STOP THIS EXECUTION.

Please, sir, commute the death sentence for Angel Nieves Diaz. 
 
The request for commutation has been made by many more important than I; the Governor of Puerto Rico, the Bishops of the Catholic Church  of the State of Florida, and many, many citizens in Florida and in the United States.  
 
You do have the right to save Angel Diaz's life.  No one wishes to see the State of Florida responsible for a death when it could be prevented, especially with so many people and groups praying for a life to be spared.  Why would you not want to use Executive Clemency to save his life? Why?

The Honorable Jeb Ellis Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
PL 05 The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001


Dear Governor Bush,

I appeal to you to do everything in your power to stop the execution of Puerto
Rican national Angel Nieves Diaz.  Mr. Diaz is scheduled to be executed on December
13, 2006, for the 1979 death of Joseph Nagy.

Post-conviction assessments by two mental health experts concluded that Angel
Diaz suffers from certain mental disorders, which contributed to his decision
to represent himself and undermined his ability to do so competently. The presiding
trial judge allowed Mr. Diaz to represent himself even though Mr. Diaz spoke minimal
English, had no knowledge about the law, and had not even completed high school.
Many mentally ill defendants have insisted on representing themselves despite
widespread evidence of their incompetence to do so.

Moreover, during the sentencing phase of this trial, acute disparities in sentencing
became apparent. Despite conflicting evidence about the actual gunman and the
use of unreliable testimony by a jailhouse informant, one defendant received a
life sentence while Mr. Diaz was condemned to death.  Furthermore, evidence was
not raised at the trial about Mr. Diaz's childhood abuse, history of mental problems,
and issues associated with longtime drug addition.  

I am also concerned to learn that a key prosecution witness at the 1985 trial
has recanted his testimony, which had been a key part of the evidence that convicted
Mr. Diaz of murder.

It is deeply unsettling that this execution would proceed while Florida's capital
justice system remains mired in geographic and racial disparities. Florida is
also the only state in the country that does not require a jury to be unanimous
in recommending the death penalty.  In this case, it should be noted that four
of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty.

I have tremendous sympathy for the family and friends of Joseph Nagy, but I
believe capital punishment only perpetuates the cycle of violence. 

Governor Bush, I strongly urge you to demonstrate your respect for justice and
human life by doing everything in your power to stop the execution of Angel Nieves
Diaz.  

Thank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.

Estimado Gobernador de Florida, Don Jeb Bush:

Tengo a bien darle mis mas sinceras gracias y entregarle todo mi respeto por haber contestado a mi correo electronico comentandole que habia llegado a mi conocimiento el caso particular de Angel Nieves Diaz, ciudadano de Florida y condenado a pena de muerte en 1985 por el asesinato de Joseph Nagy, asesinado el 29 de Diciembre de 1979 en el bar que regentaba (Velvet Swong Lounge), cuando tres atracadores robaron en el establecimiento. No hubo testigos presenciales del disparo y Angel nieves Diaz y Angel Toro fueron condenados por asesinato en primer grado en 1984, pero el juicio se retraso hasta Diciembre de 1985, para entonces Angel Toro ya se habia declarado culpable de asesinato en primer grado a cambio de una pena de cadena perpetua.

   La exnovia de Angel Diaz testifico que, la noche del delito, este le dijo que Angel Toro habia disparado contra un hombre durante el robo. Ademas el testimonio de otras dos personas, que se encontraban en el bar durante el atraco declararon que Angel Diaz no habia sido el autor de los diaparos, sin embargo, un informador encarcelado, Ralf Gajus, declaro que, mientras estaban en la prision, Angel Diaz habia declarado que habia disparado a Joseph Nagy.

Ralf Gajus ha realizado ahora una declaracion jurada en la que dice su testimonio en el jucio fue falso, y que Angel Diaz nunca le confeso que fuera el autor de los disparos. Afirma que su testimonio en el juicio fue motivado por el deseo de obtener el favor de la fiscalia en su propio caso de asesinato. En el juicio declaro que no le habian prometido nada a cambio por su testimonio, sin embargo , en la determinacion de la pena de su caso, un policia habia testificado sobre la ayuda que Gajus habia prestado a la fiscalia.

Durante las deliberaciones del jurado en el caso de Angel Diaz, el jurado pidio copias del testimonio de Gajus, pero el juez se nego a proporcionarselas, y dio instrucciones al jurado de que basaran su veredicto en lo que el testigo habia dicho. El veredicto  del jurado fue de culpabilidad. La retraccion de Ralf Gajus pone aun mas en duda la fiabilidad del veredicto de 1985. 

El 27 de Noviembre, los abogados de Angel Diaz presentaron una nueva mocion basandose en este nuevo hecho, aun asi, sigue previsto que Angel Diaz sea ejecutado antes de acabar el ao.

Le agradezco que halla empleado parte de su valiso tiempo a leer mi correo electronico, y a poner en mi conocimiento todo lo referente a la ley de  pena de muerte que rige en el Estado de Florida, para nada estoy cuestionando la manera que tienen ustedes de juzgar a los presuntos delincuentes, lo unico que le pido es que Angel Nieves Diaz reciba un juicio justo, basado en las pruebas y testimonios fiables, y se le de la oportunidad de ser juzgado con todas las garantias que ofrece el sistema judicial de Florida, sin ser discriminado por su raza, credo o cualquier otra condicion que sea motivo de discriminacion.

Espero y deseo fervientemente que intervenga en este caso, y desde su ilustre persona se garantice que Angel Nieves Diaz reciba pues un nuevo juicio, donde sus abogados puedan demostrar que el no fue el autor de los disparos que causaron la muerte desgraciadamente de Joseph Nagy.

                                                                                                    Atenta y respetuosamente, Edurne Arriazu.

Subject: Regaarding a death row inmate
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2006 11:13:24 -0500


Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush about a death row inmate.  The Governor appreciates your  concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.

 

Governor Bush believes that the death penalty is appropriate and warranted in certain capital murder cases, and supports its use by the courts in those cases.  The Governor also believes we should look not only to the issues surrounding the defendant, but also to the surviving victims, and to the effect the murder has on our community as a whole, in deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment.

 

Florida law provides numerous levels of appeals for the convicted individual before the sentence is moved.  Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.  No other state has invested the public resources in capital post conviction legal representation that Florida has been providing for well over a decade. 

 

Governor Bush shares the concerns of many that the death penalty must be reserved for only the most heinous cases.  As the Governor has said many times, the signing of a death warrant is one of the most solemn and somber responsibilities he must undertake, and he does so with humble deliberation.

 

Again, thank you for taking the time to write about this very serious issue.

 

Sincerely,

 

Warren Davis

problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en 
Florida, entre ellos la existencia de disparidades 
geogrficas y raciales y el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad

Dear Sirs,

I m writing to you to oppose the execution of ngel Nieves 
Daz, based on a number of facts which cast doubt on his 
capacity to represent himself, and the fairness of his trial.

First of all I would like to manifest my support for the 
family of Joseph Nagy, killed in 1979, and explain that in no 
way do I mean to belittle the gravity of the crime 
committed, nor of the suffering it has caused. 

There is, however, considerable disparity in this case, in 
which one of the accused has been condemned to death, while 
another has received a life sentence, despite the 
contradictory testimonies about who fired the shots. 

I feel extremely concerned about the use of a testimony 
from somebody in jail against ngel Daz, because history has 
shown that these types of testimonies are notoriously 
untrustworthy.

I remind you also that four members of the jury did not 
vote in favour of the death sentence in this case. 

I also draw your attention to the fact that a recent 
investigation has identified serious problems in the system of 
the application of the death penalty in Florida, amongst 
which figure the geographic and racial disparities, and the 
fact that a unanimous decision by the jury is not required to 
impose the death penalty.  

For the above reasons I ask the governor to intervene and 
prevent the death penalty in this case. 

Yours sincerely,

Subject:	Please commute sentence of Angel Diaz to life without parole 

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Angel Diaz should not be executed on December 13th.  At a time when the Florida death penalty system is under serious question in terms of
its fairness and high risk of executing people for crimes which they have not commited (see findings of Florida special ABA commission
issued September 19, 2006) it is timely and appropriate to commute Angel Diaz's sentence to life without parole. Although I believe he
may be innocent of the crime of which he was convicted and sentenced to death, I would not ask you to pardon him but merely not to
allow his execution.   There are just too many questions both in his specific case regarding innocence and fairness and too many
questions regarding the fairness and accuracy of Florida's death penalty system to permit his execution.   Having said this, I feel 
tremendous sadness and sympathy for Joseph Nagy's family but I do not believe that the execution of a man who is very possibly 
innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to death will ease their suffering. In fact, the death penalty in this case has created much 
more suffering for them than the alternative of life without the possibility of parole.  This may also be a timely juncture to consider a 
moratorium on the death penalty in Florida in light of the findings of the special ABA Florida commission.
 
Many thanks for your kind consideration,
 
Judith Caruso, attorney at law

GOVERNOR BUSH,
 
WE ARE THE FAMILY OF ANGEL NIEVES DIAZ, WE IMPLORE TO YOU THAT YOU
PLEASE REVIEW THE INFORMATION I HAVE ATTACHED TO YOU IN REFERENCE TO MY
UNCLE'S CASE.
 
THERE WERE MANY ERRORS AND MIS INFORMATION IN THE LETTER YOU REPLIED TO
OUR GOVERNOR OF PR AND THE SENATE.
 
ANGEL N. DIAZ DID NOT RECEIVE JUSTICE IN HIS TRIAL. 
 
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON WE PLEAD THAT YOU HAVE MERCY AND ASK THAT YOU TAKE
A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME TO REVIEW THIS INFORMATION. OUR FAMILY CONSISTS OF
ATLEAST 400 MEMBERS AND THE SYSTEM IS SHATTERING THE CHRISTMAS OF
ATLEAST 150 CHILDREN IN THIS FAMILY. 
WE LOVE AND RESPECT MY UNCLE, ALL WE ASK IS THAT HE RECEIVES A FAIR
TRIAL.
 
WE ARE DEVASTATED, OUR CHILDREN ARE DEVASTED, OUR CHRISTMAS, A TIME
WHERE WE CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST, WE ARE BEING FORCED TO BE A
PART OF THE DEATH OF AN INNOCENT MAN.
 
HE IS A WONDERFUL, FATHER, SON, BROTHER, GRANDPA, COUSIN, AND UNCLE. 
HE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL BEING, THAT ONCE ANYONE MEETS HIM, THEY ARE
CAPTIVATED AND WANT TO STAY CLOSE TO HIM.  THIS CONSISTS OF FRIENDS OF
THE FAMILY , SARGENTS, CAPTAINS, GUARDS , AND WARDENS. 
 
THE SHOOTER OF THIS CRIME HAS EVEN ADMITTED IN THE ATTACHED AFFIDAVIT
THAT HE IS AN INNOCENT MAN.
 
ONCE AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLORE TO YOU, THAT YOU REVIEW THIS ONCE
MORE.
 
AT THE VERY MINIMUM PLEASE GRANT HIM 30 DAYS MORE, SINCE THE COURTS
HAVE BLOCKED ACCESS TO HIS APPEAL ATTORNEYS TO ANY FURTHER EVIDENCE OR
MATERIALS.  
 
IF THIS IS GRANTED THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS INFORMATION
IS TRUE.
 
GOD BLESS YOU AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO TAKE A MINUTE OF YOUR VERY
BUSY SCHEDULE TO REVIEW THIS ONE FINAL TIME.
 
 
 
SINCERELY, 
THE NIEVES, DIAZ, OTERO, TORRES, GONZALEZ, FAMILY

Subject:	Re: Richard Paey

Governor Bush,
While your reply brings up legitimate issues with the question of 
clemency, it completely misses the point. Your email seems to suggest 
that Richard Paey's case should be handled by the Florida court system 
and Parole Commission. In case you are not already aware, Richard Paey 
has taken his case to the highest level possible in the Florida court 
system, and the court concluded that while the law was fair, his 
particular case was not and that he should appeal to you for clemency. 
The Florida Parole Commission is completely powerless due to the 
mandatory minimum sentence given. To shrug Mr. Paey's case off as "not 
my problem" is irresponsible and a failure of your duty to the state of 
Florida. The power of granting clemency was vested in you for a reason, 
and plenty of previous governors have not hesitated to use it in cases 
where it was necessary. Please do not use the "complicated rules and 
lengthly procedures" that you talk about as an excuse for ignoring an 
innocent man's plight.
Signed,
Thomas Coates Welsh

> As you may know, the Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in criminal court cases.  Each state attorney is an elected official charged with certain discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether or not to prosecute any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction.  This decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt shown, and in the best interest of justice.  Questions about the guilt or innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to commit a crime, or the procedural fairness of their convictions must be addressed in the courts. Those who wish to contest judicial rulings should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available. 
>
> Decisions over prisoners' movement within the system, rehabilitative or educational programs, temporary release permission, and incentive gain time are under the authority of the Department of Corrections.  The Florida Parole Commission, an entity independent of the Governor's control, determines the issues of control release and early release.  
>
> The clemency function is a power to grant full or conditional pardons, restore a felon's civil rights, or commute punishment.  There are complicated rules for these lengthy procedures, and these powers are vested in the Governor only with the agreement of three Cabinet members who are also statewide elected officials. Clemency for prisoners is seldom granted, as it is necessary to await the outcome of court appeals.  For more information, you can write the Office of Executive Clemency at Building C, Room 229, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida  32399-2450.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens cependant, Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique.

Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 

Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 

Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Mister the Governor, 
I learned that Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 years, must be carried out on December 13, 2006. It was condemned to died in 1986 for the murder of Joseph Nagy, the manager of the bar of the Living room Velvet Swing, made on December 29, 1979 in Miami whereas three men carried out a holdup in the bar. The business is serious and painful, since it acts of a crime: justice must be returned, and the family of Joseph Nagy has right to all my compassion. 
Before the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, I hold Mister the Governor, to recall you that several points deserve to be checked, under penalty of sending innocent on the electric chair: First of all, there was no eyewitness when the shot was drawn. Angel Toro, another member of the group of the holdup, was condemned to the life sentence whereas certain elements would indicate that it is him which would have drawn the mortal blow. Moreover, four of sworn did not vote in favour of the death sentence. 
This disparity of the sorrows remains nevertheless very surprising and I am astonished that the unanimity of the jury is not necessary for the judgments with the capital punishment.
Lastly, I make a point of stressing that the judge indicated itself to Angel Diaz which taking into account the fact that it was not able to be expressed in English in front of the court, that it was not informed any in right and that it had stopped his studies before the end of the secondary, the court considered that it was impossible for him to ensure itself his defense. What Angel Diaz nevertheless did. 
I ask you, Mister the Governor, to be so kind as to take all these elements in account and to prevent the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, of which the culpability does not seem to me not established. 
Sincerely yours 
Mary
 
Pavageau

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue. 

 
Brigitte et Christian Jgo

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Monsieur le gouverneur, 

L'excution d'Angel Diaz est prvue pour le 13 dcembre. Il est donc urgent que j'ajoute ma voix  tant d'autres pour rclamer son annulation. Des doutes persistants planent sur sa culpabilit. Ce ne serait pas la premire fois qu'un innocent a t condamn  mort (il y en a eu 22 en Floride depuis 1973) : l'erreur judiciaire est donc une possibilit que vous ne pouvez pas carter.

Dans l'espoir que vous tiendrez compte de notre action,

Frdric SIMON, parisien humaniste

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Monsieur 
je me permets du haut de mes 17 ans
de vous faire remarquer avec tout le respect que je vous dois, que vous vous apretez a envoyer un homme sur la chaise electrique, alors que des points sur cette affaire semblent flous et peux vrdiques.
Vivant en France, dans ce pays ou la peine de mort est depuis longtemps abolie, je ne comprends pas de quel droit des hommes dcident de la vie ou la mort d'un autre homme. au nom de qui le faites vous ?
l'institution ? dieu ? 
quelles que soient vos raisons, rien ne vous donne le droit d'enlever la vie d'autrui !
Je souhaite que la peine de mort soit abolie au plus vite.
punir un crime par un autre crime, revient a adopter un comportement d'tat de nature et rien d'une socit d'tres rationneles et humains .
une jeune francaise pleine d'esprance...

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

For starters it's regarding, not regaarding. In reading your responce to my plea for humanitarianism, it is clear that you are very uneducated. Your free legal representation is highly flawed, and has been proven as such several times. These defense lawyers do not call witnesses, do not present evidence, and fail to properly defend these human beings.
     You can call it whatever you want, but murder is bad, and YOUR murdering this person is just as bad as what he did. You cite the victim's families. What about the family of Angel Diaz? It has been proven that the families of those who are MURDERED by the government go through the same mental distress as those who are murdered by these people.
     You say that Gov. Bush saves the death penalty for the most heinous cases, then why is Florida second only to Texas in carrying out these death sentences? Funny how the states who murder the most inmates are also the states with the most capital cases. Your system is flawed, and maybe you should ALL educate yourselves before you murder people. You are not God, stop acting like it.

Dear Governor, 
Thank you for your thoughtful letter sent via Warren Davis. It was much appreciated. 
Yours sincerely 
John Collings-Wells. 

On 12 Dec 2006, at 16:13, Governor Jeb Bush wrote: 


Dear Friend: 

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush about a death row inmate.  The Governor appreciates your  concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf. 
  
Governor Bush believes that the death penalty is appropriate and warranted in certain capital murder cases, and supports its use by the courts in those cases.  The Governor also believes we should look not only to the issues surrounding the defendant, but also to the surviving victims, and to the effect the murder has on our community as a whole, in deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment. 
  
Florida law provides numerous levels of appeals for the convicted individual before the sentence is moved.  Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Subject:	Re: Regarding a death row inmate

Dear Mr. Davis:

As a catholic I can not believe in death penalty. Jesus was condemned at a court and sentenced to death because of false staments (lies) and prejudice. In Mr. Nieves case this person was sentenced by 
a lie of another inmate that has confessed NOW his lies.

Only God has the right to give and to end our lives no body else. We all know that many people around the world are sentenced because of crimes that were committed by others that are at the free
community. We all know that unfortunately in our nation the USA it exists a big discrimination toward Hispanics, Latins and blacks because of the used of stereotypes.

After Mr. Nieves death, if the investigations that are asked by his attorney, reflected he is innocent who the USA Courts and Mr. Bush will feel about? If there is a great doubt like in this case including in its due process how come a person is going to be killed?

Death Penalty is no the solution to crimes, the solution is to make people live in peace
and education.

Cordially,

Subject:	Regarding the death row inmate Angel Nieves Diaz

Dear Mr Warren,

thank you very much for responding me. 

Concering the problem of the death penalty in this special case of Angel Nieves Diaz let me just point out that it is not proved that is was Mr Diaz who pulled the trigger and shot the barkeeper in Miami.
I am not trying to downplay the suffering caused through this death. Mr Diaz deserves to be punished for robbery. But it is not proved that he was it who shot the man in the bar.

Executing Mr Diaz now runs the risk of killing an innocent.

Yours respectfully,

Monika Frohnapfel

Betreff: Regaarding a death row inmate


Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush about a death row inmate.  The Governor appreciates your  concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.

 

Governor Bush believes that the death penalty is appropriate and warranted in certain capital murder cases, and supports its use by the courts in those cases.  The Governor also believes we should look not only to the issues surrounding the defendant, but also to the surviving victims, and to the effect the murder has on our community as a whole, in deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment.

 

Florida law provides numerous levels of appeals for the convicted individual before the sentence is moved.  Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.  No other state has invested the public resources in capital post conviction legal representation that Florida has been providing for well over a decade. 

 

Governor Bush shares the concerns of many that the death penalty must be reserved for only the most heinous cases.  As the Governor has said many times, the signing of a death warrant is one of the most solemn and somber responsibilities he must undertake, and he does so with humble deliberation.

 

Again, thank you for taking the time to write about this very serious issue.

 

Sincerely,

 

Warren Davis

Dear Warren Davis,
 
Thank your for your prompt reply.  Please, let Jeb Bush know that I appreciate his deliberations regarding committing a person to death.  Please, tell him that I'm part of a family where there was a double murder, and WE ARE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY.  My father and I are part of a national organization called Murder Victim Families for Reconciliation.  We're all opposed to the death penalty.  We are NOT opposed to ALTERNATIVES to the death penalty.  Killing another person will not bring the victim back.  Please, remind Jeb Bush that Jesus was a victim of the death penalty.  I once saw a person with a miniature electric chair on a delicate chain around his neck instead of a cross.  It brings it home.
 
Again, thank you.
 
Gentle blessings,
Wendy Clarissa Geiger,

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale.

Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue. 

 
Roger-Raymond

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

Monsieur le Gouverneur, 

Jai appris que Angel Nieves Diaz, 55 ans, doit tre excut le 13 dcembre 2006. 
Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre de Joseph Nagy, le grant du bar du Salon Velvet Swing, commis le 29 dcembre 1979  Miami alors que trois hommes effectuaient un hold-up dans le bar. Laffaire est grave et pnible, puisquil sagit dun crime : justice doit tre rendue, et la famille de Joseph Nagy a droit  toute ma compassion. 

Avant lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, je tiens Monsieur le Gouverneur,  vous rappeler que plusieurs points mritent dtre vrifis, sous peine denvoyer un innocent sur la chaise lectrique : 
Tout dabord, il ny avait pas de tmoin oculaire lorsque le coup de feu a t tir. 
Angel Toro, un autre membre du groupe du hold-up, a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit alors que certains lments indiqueraient que cest lui qui aurait tir le coup mortel. Dailleurs, quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort. Cette disparit des peines reste nanmoins trs surprenante et je mtonne que lunanimit du jury ne soit pas requise pour les condamnations  la peine capitale. 
Enfin, je tiens  souligner que le juge a lui-mme indiqu  Angel Diaz que compte tenu du fait quil ntait pas en mesure de sexprimer en anglais devant le tribunal, quil navait aucune connaissance en droit et quil avait arrt ses tudes avant la fin du secondaire, le tribunal considrait quil lui tait impossible dassurer lui-mme sa dfense. Ce que Angel Diaz a nanmoins fait. 

Je vous demande, Monsieur le Gouverneur, de bien vouloir prendre tous ces lments en compte et dempcher lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz, dont la culpabilit ne me semble pas tablie. 

Je vous prie dagrer, Monsieur le Gouverneur, lexpression de ma considration distingue.

 It's my ex-wife for one thing. It's a criminal probe into the S.A.O. ,and the C.C.S.O., is what I'm asking for. No sane person could look at this crime scene and think, she was not protecting herself from harm. in her own home. The front door was kicked in by her assailant, (Micheal Dales, AKA Micheal Dallas) her abusive husband. The police knew his father is a retired law enforcement officer and that tainted their investigation!!! Does the Atty. General allow this type misconduct? Please serve as the sword of justice and investigate this. If I'm wrong then, I'm wrong. If I'm right, then a great injustice has been prevented.

Dear Warren Davis, Governor Bush has had his on family problems I know I 
read the papers and I sympathize with him because he is in the limelight, 
but to keep a person in jail for a year on charges that we his family have 
proven are false is ridiculous. Oh I heard from his attorney and the state 
attorney on his case wants him to take time served and probation and still 
have a felony on his record. there is no way. When she first filed the 
domestic charges back in february of 2005 the county told her she didnt have 
enough evidence to do anything. So what does she do she comes up with this 
tape she says is Danny's voice on there. For one thing Mr Davis he wasnt 
even in broward county and he had no contact with her on the date of Feb. 
17th 2005. Another thing she didnt turn over these tapes till april of 2005 
two weeks before she went back to live with him in tennessee. That 
information is on the discovery because danny read it to me. Andrew Newman 
is the state Attorney. Danny should walk out of their with a clean 
slate,because he was set up. If anybody should have charges filed aganist 
them its her. For filing false reports. To You Governor Bush I am going to 
tennessee this coming weekend for christmas and I would like for my brother 
to be there as a free man. If all charges are dropped nothing will ever be 
said about this. He'll come home and go on with his life, but if he has to 
come out with a felony on him and make it hard for him to find work then 
justice will not have been served. His ex played the victim very well. She 
tried to take a elderly lady for all  she had some years back before she met 
danny  but the ladies nephew took her to court and she didnt get nothing. 
The reason she done this to danny is because on March 6,. 2003 Danny fell 
off a ladder and almost died. He was worth about 5 million dollars and if he 
had died it would have been double idenitiy because it would have been 
declared and accident, but he didnt die and their marriage started doing 
down hill because he didnt die and make her a wealthy woman. ten million 
dollars worth. Also the christmas of 2003 on my visit home in one of our 
converstion we where having the night before i was to leave to come  home 
back to alabama where i live. They were on the outs with each other. She 
admitted to me she shook the ladder and made him fall because she wanted him 
dead. Its my word aganist hers but she said it. Justice will be served when 
he walks out of that jail after being there without nothing done and no 
felony hanging on him. This woman is a destroyer Goveror Bush. She was going 
to try and have our Mother deemed incompetent. Our Mother was living with 
them at the time.My older brother who is deceased now and my sister and I 
got our Mother out of there and into a very nice housing project. She was on 
the verge of a nervous breakdown because of this woman. Governor Bush Danny 
was obsessed with this woman and loved her more than anything. Its called 
blind love. He forsaked his kids and all of us for her. She lived the life 
of a Queen.He gave her anything she wanted but it wasnt enough she wanted it 
all even it meant death.Governor Bush Being in jail opened up his eyes and 
gave him a lot of time to think. He head has finally healed from the fall. 
the numbness he had in his face is fianlly going away. The Danny I talked to 
now is the danny i knew before he met this woman. She is in Union City where 
We Grew up.Thats where he wants to go back to because his kids are there and 
so is my sister and mother. He can go on with his life as he plans to and 
will not bother her. He travels alot putting in computers for major 
companies.He will not bother her and if she tries to contact him he will get 
a restraining order,because there divorced and she has no reason to contact. 
I know this a lot but I felt like the truth should ben told. I just hope 
justices gets served the right way.

Dear Ms. Merrell:

Thank you for your letter to Governor Bush about your brother who is facing 
criminal charges.  He understands the pain friends and family experience in 
these situations and asked me to respond.

As you may know, the decision to charge a person for crimes is made by the 
state attorney, a locally elected official.  Deciding whether or not to 
charge a person is based on the best interests of justice and on the 
quantity and quality of the evidence of criminal activity.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that 
should be resolved through the court system.  If you believe a person is 
innocent, or not guilty of all charges, you may wish to obtain the services 
of an attorney experienced in criminal defense. If you need assistance in 
locating an attorney, please call the Florida Bar's Referral Service at 
1-800-342-8011.

Those who are facing criminal charges for which prison time is a 
possibility, may be appointed an attorney by the court.  For further 
assistance in this regard, please contact the office of your locally elected 
public defender.  Please be sure the attorney is provided with all of the 
evidence you believe shows innocence.

The Governor trusts justice will be served in this case.

                                                                        Sincerely,

Dear Jeb Bush,    Iam writign to you again about my brother who is 
incarcerated in your Broward County Jail. He has been there since Jan, 6th 
of this year only three calendar calls and no trial. My sister and I have 
sent proof to the state attorney of Broward County showing that on the date 
that is specified on the court clerk files of Feb. 17th 2005 that Robert 
Danny Owens was no where in the state of florida and did not have no contact 
with the victim on that date. Mr. Bush Robert Danny Owens rights are being 
violated according to the Florida Preamble. He has been been held 
excessively in jail longer than he should have been. No trial, unexcessively 
communication with his PD, no deposition from the victim like the PD was 
suppose to do. We have the proof it was all made up only because the victim 
wanted a divorce. Your state is violating his rights for keeping him for a 
year and not doing anything. If he still there after the first of the year 
we his family are going to a major network and tell our story of how the 
state of Florida holds people in jail for excessively amounts of time and 
violating their rights according to the florida preamble.

Attached are the criminal charges that I filed with the Lake Country Sheriff's Department. This not a joke there charges are real. I have the documentation to back these criminal charges.  
 
I'm a disabled 45 year old white male and just started out to provide for my ill grandmother and sister and her 2 boys by putting a home on the land that I own free and clear.  I'm now injeepperty of losing everything I owned outright. This is because of attorneys, which think they are above the law. In fact the lead attorney Ms. Morley told me she couldn't be touched and she was above the law. This is the same attorney that is now to sit as a Lake County Judge. A side note Ms. Morley has not lived in Lake County for several years. All the attorneys are guilty of all the charges listed; this includes violating my Constructional Rights. The mortgage company and its attorneys have and are still breaking criminal laws to this day and are getting away with it. Why? Because the State and Federal government knew and have try everything to suppress the information and don't care about my Rights or justice served. That the Bar Association  and the lawyers that belong give out false information on giving help to the needy or indigent. 
 
I am here to put it on record there is no justice in this country if you're poor or indigent. Only if you're rich you can bend the laws and politicians to represent you and your rights, or interests. The whole time I went to school I was taught that there was justice for every citizen in this country. Well it has been proven to be a lie. I have been told by Legal Aid we can't help you, and you're basically SOL. This is yet more false information that the Bar Association has listed on the internet. Ever politician and government agency listed was contacted, and the criminal charges do apply.  
 
I will gladly answer any question you have; my number is 352-669-7478

Thank you for replying to my e-mail.

My attorney is going to sue Florida Hospital/ Adventist Health System  and 
Dr Lonsdorfer for kidnapping and torture.  I love America and am saddened 
deeply that this could happen to myself ( British Citizen).

Our countries are best friends and I just cannot get over the brutality, 
neither can my MP of the treatment that I received in your State and

I have suffered from compartment syndrome and have this documented by Doctor

Florida.

We are now living back in the UK having set up our internet bulb company in
the USA.  We have been in business since 1860  and supply many members of
the British Aristocracy, not to mention supplying historic houses etc. in
the UK.

Whilst being treated at Celebration Hospital over three and a half years ago
my wife was subjected to extreme cruelty.  I contacted Pat Hall and also
engaged the well respected firm of Bogin, Munns and Munns to deal with this
matter.

Too date this matter has not been resolved, although we now live in the UK,
as Bogin, Munns and Munns decided to drop the case.

My wife, Naomi Blom suffers from panic attacks and was on the drug Xanax, at
the time she took 10 X 2mg of these tablets, she was extremely anxious, as
her best friend in Malaysia had just died and on the same day discovered
from her mother in the UK that her father had cancer.  She panicked, after
taking these tablets and I immediately took her to ER at Celebration
Hospital ( at this conjesture, I must add that she had afull unopened bottle
of 100 X 2mg of this drug, so, obviously her intention was not to kill
herself).  We have three boys whom we both love dearly.

I am sending you these photographs of her hand, where an orderly grabbed her
whilst I was out of the hospital trying to reach the British Embassy,  the
incident with the ordrly left her hand disfigured, not to mention the severe
PTSD she still suffers.  I thought that you should be aware of this incident
as it happened in your State.  Pat Hall has always been and continues to be
most supportive of both myself and my wife.

Whilst writing, I must congratulate you on the high standards of education
in Osceola County, our children flourished whilst they were there, in
particular my eldest son Chris, who took part in band and had the
opportunity to play at Disneyworld.  He is now studying A Levels here and
hopes to be able to attend medical School in New York.
The hospitality we received from your fellow citizens was fantastic and we
were very sorry to have to leave when business brought us back to the UK.

By nature, we are Conservative and therefore Republicans.
Your brother, The President is doing a fantastic job, it's a pity that more
world leaders do not have his strength and absolute resolve.

I am sorry that I have had to contact you with regard to this, however would
not like this sort of incident to occur to anyone else.

Yours most sincerely

Paul Blom

Warren Davis,

If I am not getting a response from Law Enforcement then were is the appeal 
mechanism (I appreciate that the Governor is not a member of the Judicial 
Branch of Government but surely someone in Government should be worried 
about Yvonne's and other such similar companies)?

Who is responsible for regulation as it appears that companies like Yvonne's 
are allowed to be 'above the law' through various loop holes?

Have you Honourable Jerry Hills email address and can she/he advise on a 
judicial review?

Dear Friends:

Thank you for writing again.

Governor Bush is a statewide elected official who serves as a member of the 
Executive Branch of Government.  A description of the Governor's duties and 
powers is delineated in TITLE IV, CHAPTER 14 of the Florida Constitution and 
can be located at www.leg.state.fl.us or 
http://leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=Ch0014/titl0014.htm&StatuteYear=2006&Title=%2D%3E2006%2D%3EChapter%2014. 
The Governor is not a member of the Judicial Branch of Government.

Although we appreciate the opportunity to review your questions, your 
concerns and questions can best be addressed by an attorney experienced in 
the applicable law in this case.  I encourage you to direct your questions 
and concerns about bringing any civil legal action to the legal counsel of 
your choice.

Should you wish to contact the locally elected state attorney with 
discretion over criminal cases in your local judicial circuit, please 
contact the Honorable Jerry Hill, State Attorney for the 10th Judicial 
Circuit of Florida by writing to Post Office Box 9000, Drawer SA, Bartow, 
Florida 33831-9000 or call (863) 534-4800.

Should you wish to share your concerns with the Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement to advise them of your complaint, I encourage you to contact 
them at the address or phone number provided below.  To further assist you, 
I am forwarding a copy of your e-mail to that agency for their review.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor hopes this matter can be resolved 
to your satisfaction.

Dear Friends:

Thank you for writing again to Governor Bush.  The Governor asked me to
respond on his behalf.

As indicated in our previous correspondence, the Florida Constitution limits
the Governor's intervention in civil and criminal legal issues that should
be resolved through the judicial system.  I encourage you to share your

For answers to your legal questions and information about civil remedies in
this case, I encourage you to contact a private attorney at your earliest
convenience.  To locate an attorney specializing in the applicable law in
this case, please call the Florida Bar or your local Legal Services office.

Thank you again for writing.  We hope this matter can be resolved to your
satisfaction.

RE: State Liability

Dear Warren Davies,

Thank you for your reply.

We are pleaseed to hear that Governor Bush is sorry to learn of our
concerns.

Please understand this is NOT liability against Yvonne's (who most likely
have absconded and/or hidden assets) but the State of Florida (Law
Enforcement) as we have very patiently waited for a response from SP
Bradway, since the beginning of this tragedy on the 18th August 2006,
without a reply to our concerns.

We wish to know the criminal liability of Yvonne's for the fraud/theft so
that a State criminal compensation fund can be set up, also, for Yvonne's to
receive State condemnation so that do not repeat this again on innocent
individuals.

We are not sure whether this can be resolved through the court system as our
concern is the apparent negligence of the legal/political and governance
framework in terms of the lack of action taken by State Authorities (which
collect our taxes, therefore, we wish to be protected by). With respect, it
will be up to you to decide whether this is individual agency or collective
State failure.

If you are aware of anyone in the State attorney's office and local law
enforcement  (or any other means of holding the State accountable) that
could assist us as we would be interested to learn, otherwise, we wish the
Governors intervention as we see the governance system at fault for not
having a sufficient framework in place to stop rogues like Yvonne's Property
Management. The lack of government response has had a further detrimental
effect on us and frankly created a climate of mistrust.

If you are unable to assist please advise of how we can initiate a judicial
review on the basis that Yvonne's have been 'allowed to commit the same
crime again and again and the State is apparently taking a neutral role
rather than assisting the victims by leading the legal process on behalf of
the people.

Please we have already been hurt once please, don't hurt us twice.

As SA Bradway has NOT assisted us we are now looking at taking this matter
through you PERSONALLY without jurisdiction becoming a hindrance to justice
(not others such Everett, Coleman, Fleet et al ).

Please include all of us in your email reply.

Waiting for your urgent  assistance.

Dear Friends:

Thank you for your letter to Governor Bush.  Governor Bush is sorry to learn
of your concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that
should be resolved through the court system.  Each state attorney is an
elected official charged with certain discretionary duties, including the
duty to determine whether or not to prosecute any particular crime committed
within his or her jurisdiction.  This decision is based on the quality and
quantity of the evidence of guilt shown, and in the best interest of
justice.  I encourage you to work with the state attorney's office and local
law enforcement to resolve this situation.  If you have not already done so,
you may also wish to obtain private legal counsel to assist you in this
regard.   If you need assistance in locating an attorney, please call the
Florida Bar's Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.  For those unable to
afford a lawyer, Florida Legal services or your local legal aid office has
information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone
number for Florida Legal Services is 850-385-7900.

I understand you are currently working with the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement and the Florida Department of Business and Professional
Regulation to resolve your concerns in this regard.  To further assist you,
I am forwarding a copy of your e-mail to those agencies for their review and
response.  I am confident someone from those Departments will contact you at
their convenience.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems
you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.  Please know this
is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.

                                                                        Sincerely,

Dear Mr J Bush,

We are respectfully writing to you to inform you that we are in the process
of establishing a campaign program.

This will be a long hard battle, with no option for withdrawal, therefore
your early intervention may resolve this.

Our main argument against the regulator(s) is their failure to protect us
through proper regulation/enforcement thus creating damaging and detrimental
effect on us.

We are happy to end our campaign if (and only if) 1/ The Bernstein's receive
appropriate sentence for their actions 2/ We are compensated for our losses
3/ We are compensated to work with you to ensure such incidents do not
re-occur and the state has learnt lessons.

We must say we are very disappointed indeed with the apparent lack of
concern shown by SA Broadway.

We hope you are able to assist us.

With kind regards.

Yvonnes Property Managment has stolen over $1M since declaration on the 18th
August 2006.

We are not sure how they have disposed of the assets or whether extraditon
is needed.

As explained to you, time is of the essence as owners are experiencing

Dear Special Agent Jacquelyn Bradway,
RE: Fraud - Yvonnes Property Management: (jacquelynbradway@fdle.state.fl.us
/ 863 607 3808),
It is encouraging that you are conducting an independent investigation into
Yvonne's Property Management in terms of their criminal liability into this
era of post-ENRON white collar crime.
We, the undersigned, are working collectively to resolve this serious
matter.
We would like to support your investigation and would like you to clarify
clarification of the following points:
1 When did your investigation start and What is the scope and terms of
reference of your investigation?

2 How were complaints (to various bodies such as DACS/BBB/DBPR et al), over
a long period of time, collectively heeded before Yvonnes decided to go out
of business?

3 Have you spoken to all (existing/previous) customers of Yvonne's?

4 Have you spoken to Yvonne's staff ( Hutch/Howard Hutcheson, Will Montalvo,
Miriam Cosme, Abby Caraballo, Lonka Carlos, Sherry Pursell, Kelly Jaspan,
Patricia Lampinski, Tim Lutz, Ismael Santiago, Annett Gladden, Farancia
Martin, Eric Allen, Neil Moore, Tim Kudlock etc ?)

5 Have you interviewed and investigated their sales representative Mike
Sills regarding potential real estate fraud or other illegal activities?

6 How are you taking into account the information on www.top-forums.com ,
mike.grogan@theledger.com and the whistle blowing incident as per
http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060928/REPORTER/[REDACTED]/1068/YOURTOWN29
etc

7 How many times has Yvonne's set up business and then filed for bankruptcy
(or simply gone out of business) only to open up shop again and start
fraudulent activity again (under same or different company name)?

8 How can Yvonne's bankruptcy be explained when their literature (attached)
suggested they could sustain hurricanes AND another 911 - Do you see this as
a gross violation of trade descriptions or not explicit fraud?

9 What legislation regulates setting up of a legitimate company and did
Yvonne's comply (if yes, who validated their application and on what
grounds)?

10 Has Yvonne's actually declared bankruptcy and what are the non-civil
implications and otherwise?

11 How can we find out if they have sufficient assets before spending more
dollars on a civil action (we have already suffered once and hope you do not
make us suffer again)?

12 What has Yvonne's done with all the paperwork including personal details,
bank information, termite certificates and licences?

13 If our personal information is used as part of identity fraud or phising
what action are you able to take?

14 Why were keys left outside Yvonne's property (collected by CONTEMPO at
Contempo Plaza, 43344 Hwy. 27. Davenport, FL 33837) - do you consider this
action by Yvonnes as gross negligence beyond civil boundaries e.g. thieves
could have just walked past, collected the keys (and god forbid) broken into
ALL of our homes ?

15 Can it be explained why relatives/staff of Yvonne's stayed in client
homes without approval - is this clear evidence that Yvonne's did not have
any intention to paying owners right from the beginning?

16 Can it be explained why some homes, under Yvonne's control, were broken
into items stolen and/or damaged - do you see this as gross violation of the
human right of owners?

17 When will you be able to confirm if Yvonne's did (or did not) operate
with deception and are worthy of being charged with fraudulent business
activity leading to criminal proceedings - can you please explain how we can
be engaged in this process?

18 What happens to Yvonne's funds if they are found to be criminally liable;
e.g. do homeowners receive the money that was stolen from them?
If found guilty, what penalty can Walter and Yvonne's expect and what can be
done to stop Yvonne and Walter Bernstein from setting up another business
and operating this scam again?

19 Can a lien be put against their assets and property until this matter is
resolved and can an injection be gained to stop them escaping abroad with
our money (unless they have already put our money in accounts outside the
United States of America ?

20 Please find the attached documents used to invoke the scam including
large payments for Google listing : can you specify other evidence you are
(and are not) taking into account including the sheriffs engagement in cases
of trespassing when owners legitimately requested their money?

We would like to reinforce the fact that this inquiry has nothing to do with
the contract we (property Owners) entered into but is specifically directed
at the enticement , deception, theft and fraud (please see attachments)
which was conducted by the Bernstein's through their management company:
hopefully as a state regulator/law enforcement official you can do something
about restoring justice as soon as possible.

If nothing is done to stop this from happening again it would, in effect,
make a mockery of the law and be appear indefensible and untenable for the
State of Florida Legislature to condone.

We are aware that there is significant media interest in this matter re :
Roth/Grogan, however, we have decided not to approach the media at this
stage.

We would be grateful if you could respond by Friday 11th November 2006.

We trust you will conduct a speedy yet though investigation and keep us
informed of your actions.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I write you today as a good citizen and a person who is at his wits end regarding our system of justice.  I'm pleased to say that I have always shouldered my responsibilities and accountabilities to move forward in life - trying to live a life as a giver and not a taker.  Now turning  50, never been in trouble, never even having a traffic accident, I'm now one step from being homeless because of an encounter with a police man and exercising what everyone I've talked to was good judgment.  However, these two incidents have hurt me beyond repair and I need your help to look at this objectively because no one else can.   
 
I'll try to explain a briefly as possible. Recently I went to court to explain my actions. Although the actions were seen as doing the right thing I was convicted due to the way the law is and how instructions were given to a jury in my case. There was no room for exercising common sense.  I'm now a convicted criminal, and I and my family believe I need to appeal my case to you - as this is my only hope for a redemption of getting my life back in order. 
 
Its been a down hill road that has cost me tens of thousands of dollars, a job, job offers, disgrace, and now near bankruptcy.  My water is off, electric will soon be turned off in a few weeks, bills not being paid, mortgage near foreclosure.    
 
On July 20th  I was flying home from a short work assignment as all of my work is out of State even though all of my family lives here and here is where I live and gladly pay my taxes.  On July 20th, 2006 I flew home and had several drinks in first class over the course of several hours. Upon landing and getting my bags after midnight, I went to the parking lot to retrieve my car. I got into my car, paid the parking bill, and immediately decided that I was not going to drive home - because I had been drinking. I called a family member to pick me up at the airport and I re-parked the car at the airport. Because that is the right thing to do.  
 
An officer came up to the window of my car about a half hour later, while I was waiting, parked. The officer was called by security because I parked and stayed in the car.... It was stated that perhaps I may be a threat - why was this man staying in the car and not leaving?  
 
The DA would not bother with my case and I was advised to have a jury hear the case.  I was found guilty of a DUI.  The reason I was found guilty was because of the instructions given to the Jury from the Judge upon requesting clarification. "You the jury, must return with a guilty verdict if I could have possibly driven the car home".  He went on to say that "it did not mater if the State cannot prove I was drunk when I parked the car", "or if the software was known to be wrong", "or even the fact that I did remove the keys from the ignition while parked". "He could have driven home because Mr. Rossini knew where the keys were". Note: My lawyer brought up the fact that the software in the breathalyzer was known for its defects and the State's expert agreed. My attorney thought this was a slam dunk case. But after those instructions I knew my life was altered for the worse forever. 
 
The officer actually wound up testified in my behalf, regarding my demeanor and sound judgment not to drive home.  Again, regardless of my specific actions, the judge told the jury that I must be found guilty if I had control over the car. And if I knew were the key were, I had control. That sealed my fate. Also per the Judge instructions, he said that the State dose not have to prove that I was impaired at the time I parked the car.  The outcome:
 
I was sentence to 10 days in jail first time in my life and it was disgraceful. The judge also ordered me not to drink for 1 year (no big deal, I'm not a big drinker anyway). No liquor in my home. A 5 year suspended license and 1 year probation with 100 hours of Alternative Community Work and on and on.   The reason for the harsh sentence was because two years ago and 4 blocks away from home,   on a 15 MPH road one late night again from the airport, an officer pulled me over for no reason - the car I was driving did not look good in a upper end neighbor hood. After pulling me over he said he thought my car was part of burglary in the area. Then he asked why I was speeding, I said I do not speed. After I pointed out some facts that proved I was not a burglar or speeding, he then said I think you have been drinking. I passed his roadside test. He then wanted me to pass a breath test.  I said no unless I had a witness present or his supervisor on the scene. I simply did not trust him after this time. His answer to me was that I did not have that option as far a witness, as Florida is a consent State,  and none of this incident had to be being video taped.  My word against his and too bad for me everyone told me. 
 
I received an automatic DUI for this first offence. The reason that this is important here is because it set me up for the second offence and a harsh life changing punishment that follows. And the scary part is I'm being set up for failure and will soon be in violation of probation and could serve years in Jail. The nightmare won't let up.  I can't get out of this hole. 
 
Like I said, I'm now on 1 year probation. I being asked to take a Greyhound bus 2 times a month to Orlando from Cocoa to meet with my probation officer - I really don't even have bus money. I told the probation officer that I needed to be working and I work out of State and  even the Judge understood and allowed me  to attend AA anywhere in the country, had no objections to transferring the case or even having me write in to my probation officer each month.  I could manage this even though it limited my ability to rent a car to work over the next 5 years.
 
But the kicker came when the probation officer said that she will not allow any of the Judges conditions because the Judge used words like no objection to the transfer and may use AA time for community service. In fact the probation officer is demanding that I see her twice a month and its my problem if I violate probation.  I'm now being set up for failure and may become a violator of probation because I cannot meet the new demands. 
 
Dear Governor, my life has come intolerable and I have no one else to turn too and I know writing you is a long shot. But I've got to help myself by asking you to look into this mess for me.  Like I said in the beginning, I've never asked for favors or never complained about anything. But I've got nothing left. I'm crying out for help. 
 
By the way I tried to go through the appeal process under public assistance but that is another three page letter I'm sorry to say. 
 
I hope you read this note. 
 
Sincerely,
Roy Rossini

Well I am glad to see that you did not read or comprehend the contents
of my letter. I can not afford to file the documents needed to proceed
with my case. I can not take the time off from work to go to food
stamps. I did file online and they said I can do an interview over the
phone; however no one ever called me back and they had my cell phone so
I know I did not miss the call. None the less they declined my
application. As for "legal aid" the girl I talked to told me they do not
deal with child custody or support only divorce. I am certainly glad we
are getting a new governor because Jeb and his assistant were no help to
me at all. I have forwarded this letter, the original letter, & your
lousy response to channel 7, 10, 6, & 4. I hope that Jeb or his family
never has a problem like this (Then again he can afford a lawyer with
the salary myself & the rest of the tax payers pay him).

Subject: RE: Urgent Request-Need Assistance With Child Custody/Support

Dear Ms. Richter:

Thank you for your recent e-mail to Governor Bush requesting assistance
with a child custody matter.  He has asked me to respond.
 
Custody and visitation rulings are under the jurisdiction of the
judicial system.  Under Florida law, the court's decision in these cases
is based on the best interest of the child or children involved.  Judges
review all of the information presented to them and apply the law to
make their decision.
 
The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters
that should be resolved through the court system.  If you are unhappy
with a ruling or feel a case has not been handled according to the law,
you should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be
available.  For those unable to afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services
or the county legal aid association has information about the
availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone number of Florida
Legal Services is (850) 385-7900.  Those dissatisfied with their
representatives should consider choosing another attorney.
 
In the meantime, if you have not already done so, you may wish to
contact your branch office for the Florida Department of Children and
Families.  This agency provides economic self-sufficiency services,
temporary cash assistance, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary
assistance for needy families.  That address and telephone number can be
located in your telephone directory.
 
Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the
problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.
Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Warren Davis
Office of Citizens' Services

Subject: Urgent Request-Need Assistance With Child Custody/Support


My name is Elise Ann Richter, I have been a resident of South Florida
since 1979 (I was 7). I recently ran into to a legal issue with my
ex-husband (Rodolfo A. Richter). He moved to N. Carolina with both of
our minor children; however the youngest (14) was not getting along with
him so he decided he was going to send her to live with me in Florida.
She has been here for about a month and a half. He is still collecting
child support for her from me and I can't afford a Lawyer to represent
us in court to gain custody & child support. When I call "Legal Aid"
they say I have to qualify in order for them to help me and they do not
know how long it will be before they can assist me if I do qualify. I
tried to apply for Food Stamps-however I work everyday and cannot get to
an appointment without losing a days pay. I can't help but think I have
never been so frustrated with the system in S. Florida as much as I am
with this situation. I have to pay $50.00 to file a motion for Child
Support & Custody. I also have to pay $85.00 for him to be served in N.

Thanks for your prompt reply to my possible request for Gov. Bush. I kinda
understand....thinking there was more pardon and mercies shown in some
cases. So, I have learned my lesson God showed me thru this plea for help.
Only go to Him...He is the ultimate authority of pardons and mercies to His
children....so, thank you for your time. I will not try this avenue ever
again. I appreciate our government and understand it has many flaws, but is
superior to other countries. God bless America and Florida!! Gloria Lee,

> Dear Gov. Bush: I am Gloria Lee, 68 yr old Mother, living in The
Villages. Saw your President brother here and voted for you both. Pray for
the Bush's each day. Have a deep concern from my heart today = this is
strictly confidental and personal. My oldest son, Jeffry Mark Branson
(Mark) is 47 and lives in Naples and has been a school teacher at Baron
Collier HS for over 20 yrs....band director, music and history classes. Was
teacher of the yr. in 1999 and a favorite son of Naples Community. I just
found out Feb. was a year ago, when he resigned his teaching position
suddenly, that he had been struggling with a homosexual lifestyle, which we
have always felt was wrong. And, he was arrested for 3 days in local jail
(myheart broke for him) and when family got his bail monies up, he waited
until Oct. 24th of this year to go to court. Paid $50,000 for supposedly
the best atty. in area...and sold his house, a classic car, etc. Well, he
finally pleaded guilty to 3 lesser charges of a charge against him, from a
teenage boy in town, whom he met on a chat room for gays a yr or so prior
to resigning his job. Well, here is my concern....his sentence was for 12
yrs. and his Grandmother and parents will probably be dead by then, and all
his nieces and nephews will have graduations and weddings he cannot attend,
etc. That is not worst part....just losing his reputation, job, credibility
and everything = but his Faith in God and love of family. We all love him
unconditionally...my question....couldn't he get a lesser type sentence,
maybe house arrest for first offense, and do community service, etc.??? He
is not a hardened criminal and it scares me to think he would be with those
who are for many years....he is a good man, has many friends and a good
teacher for many years. Could you please take time (know you are so busy
with more important things these days) to have someone investigate his
case...his judges' name is Hardt, (sp?) in Collier Co. ? Mark's brother
Cliff, 44 yrs old soldier son, died in GA of massive cornary July 22nd and
we buried him with honors (was shot down twice in Desert Storm) on 9/11 in
Arlington...I have had 3 stents put in my heart from being broken with all
that has gone on for these past 20 months. Another thing....if Mark is such
a bad person to be locked up, why was he free for all these months (no
contacts with atty., very few with justice system) to roam around the US
with no police watching over him, etc.? Now, the DA decides he needs to be
locked up, after the fact. Is not true justice, Gov. Bush....is there
anything you can do to help an elderly, grieving Mother? Mark was born on
my 21st birthday, Dec. 31st....now this year, we would have to celebrate
New Years Eve and then he would have to rush down to Naples to report on
the 2nd of Jan. for jail/prison. Is beyond my thoughts, all of this. I am
pleading and begging you to investigate and help in any way....I am praying
for God to guide you in your daily work for the state and for trying to
help my son.....sorry to take up so much of your time to read this...I am
very burdened and this is a Holy Season to celebrate the Birth of our
Savior and I cannot stay focused on the bright side, for thinking of all
that has happened and what is ahead for Mark and our family. Please
acknowledge this message asap....I am counting on you to be the best Gov. I
ever knew.....

Subject:	Respect Justice: Stop Execution of A. Diaz

December 5, 2006
The Honorable Jeb Ellis Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
PL 05 The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001


Dear Governor Bush,

I appeal to you to do everything in your power to stop the execution of Puerto
Rican national Angel Nieves Diaz.  Mr. Diaz is scheduled to be executed on December
13, 2006, for the 1979 death of Joseph Nagy.

Post-conviction assessments by two mental health experts concluded that Angel
Diaz suffers from certain mental disorders, which contributed to his decision
to represent himself and undermined his ability to do so competently. The presiding
trial judge allowed Mr. Diaz to represent himself even though Mr. Diaz spoke minimal
English, had no knowledge about the law, and had not even completed high school.
Many mentally ill defendants have insisted on representing themselves despite
widespread evidence of their incompetence to do so.

Moreover, during the sentencing phase of this trial, acute disparities in sentencing
became apparent. Despite conflicting evidence about the actual gunman and the
use of unreliable testimony by a jailhouse informant, one defendant received a
life sentence while Mr. Diaz was condemned to death.  Furthermore, evidence was
not raised at the trial about Mr. Diaz's childhood abuse, history of mental problems,
and issues associated with longtime drug addition.  

I am also concerned to learn that a key prosecution witness at the 1985 trial
has recanted his testimony, which had been a key part of the evidence that convicted
Mr. Diaz of murder.

It is deeply unsettling that this execution would proceed while Florida's capital
justice system remains mired in geographic and racial disparities. Florida is
also the only state in the country that does not require a jury to be unanimous
in recommending the death penalty.  In this case, it should be noted that four
of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty.

I have tremendous sympathy for the family and friends of Joseph Nagy, but I
believe capital punishment only perpetuates the cycle of violence. 

Governor Bush, I strongly urge you to demonstrate your respect for justice and
human life by doing everything in your power to stop the execution of Angel Nieves
Diaz.  

Thank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.

- le fait que Ralph Gajus, tmoin cl de laccusation dans cette affaire soit maintenant revenu sur son tmoignage  lencontre dAngel Diaz, remet ainsi encore plus en cause la fiabilit de la dcision du jury ;

- le fait que quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort, pouvait indiquer qu'il subsistait dans leur esprit un doute quant  la culpabilit de l'accus, et que sans le tmoignage de Ralph Gajus, les jurs auraient peut-tre t plus nombreux  voter contre la peine de mort ;

Dear Governor,

Concern : death penalty : Angel Nieves Diaz, aged 55

As a member of Amnesty International, witch is, as you know an impartial organisation with purely humanitarian aims, I am expressing my sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy, who was killed in 1979, I am not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused.

But I am opposed to the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, who wasnt competent to stand the trial and especially to represent himself.

There was a disparity in sentencing in this case, one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite the fact that there was no evidence about who was the gunman.

I am expressing concern at the use of jailhouse informant testimony against Angel Diaz, a notoriously unreliable form of testimony

Four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty.

I am calling on the Governor to intervene to stop this execution.

Daring to hope that the dead sentence will be commuted in life sentence, I am sending my best salutations.

Dear Governor,

 

As I have been informed by amnesty international, Angel Nieves Diaz is to be executed on Dec. 13th for having murdered bar manager Joseph Nagy in 1979.

 

I deeply feel for the family of victim Joseph Nagy and for all the people who were close to him and I do not want to underestimate the seriousness of such a crime.

 

However, there are a lot of doubts, if the death sentence stands its ground against all the objections that can be made:

*	Obviously Angel Diaz was not capable to defend himself properly according to the justified standards in a capital punishment case, in spite of his own claims to do so.
*	There are two defendants suspicious of having killed Joseph Nagy, Angel Nieves Diaz and Angel Toro, the latter being sentenced to a life sentence.
*	The key prosecution witness Ralph Gajus has now recanted his testimony, calling into further doubt the reliability of the jurys verdict. 
*	The sentence was not given unanimously by the jury; four out of twelve voted against the death sentence. With the recanted testimony, the majority jurors sure would have voted against the death sentence.
*	Recent research has found problems with Floridas capital justice system

 

 

That is why, Mr. Governor, I call on you to intervene to stop this execution.

 

Respectfully

Attached are the criminal charges that I filed with the Lake Country Sheriffs Department. This not a joke there charges are real. I have the documentation to back these criminal charges.  

 

Im a disabled 45 year old white male and just started out to provide for my ill grandmother and sister and her 2 boys by putting a home on the land that I own free and clear.  Im now injeepperty of losing everything I owned outright. This is because of attorneys, which think they are above the law. In fact the lead attorney Ms. Morley told me she couldnt be touched and she was above the law. This is the same attorney that is now to sit as a Lake County Judge. A side note Ms. Morley has not lived in Lake County for several years. All the attorneys are guilty of all the charges listed; this includes violating my Constructional Rights. The mortgage company and its attorneys have and are still breaking criminal laws to this day and are getting away with it. Why? Because the State and Federal government knew and have try everything to suppress the information and dont care about my Rights or justice served. That the Bar Association  and the lawyers that belong give out false information on giving help to the needy or indigent. 

 

I am here to put it on record there is no justice in this country if youre poor or indigent. Only if youre rich you can bend the laws and politicians to represent you and your rights, or interests. The whole time I went to school I was taught that there was justice for every citizen in this country. Well it has been proven to be a lie. I have been told by Legal Aid we cant help you, and youre basically SOL. This is yet more false information that the Bar Association has listed on the internet. Ever politician and government agency listed was contacted, and the criminal charges do apply.  

 

I will gladly answer any question you have; my number is 352-669-7478

Subject:	death penalty-Angel Nievez Daz

Governor Jeb Bush
Dear governor:

Due to my humanitarian vocation and my interest in the elimination of death penalty and knowing that you are inclined to accept commentaries and suggestions, I hereby request  that the death penalty of  Angel Daz, with your help, be reconsidered.  Crime always causes a lot of suffering and I sincerely regret the harm done to Mr. Joseph Nagy's family as well as all that Mr. Diaz has had to face. 


 I consider that there are some elements which could lead to consider this death penalty  as a case with reasonable doubt as is the doubt of who really shot Mr. Nagy due to the contradictory testimonies and the fact that a very decisive witness, Ralph Gajus, who had swore that Angel Diaz had confessed to be the person who shot Mr. Nagy,  has now retracted himself from his previous testimony and this testimony was the base of the death sentence to Mr. A. Diaz.  Mr. Gajus has now confessed that the reason of his statement against Angel Diaz was to attract a favour from the district attorney to help him in his case.


 Another reason is that there seems to be enough evidence about his mental health as he decided to represent himself in his trial in spite of his ignorance of the laws of the U.S.A. as well as of the English language.


On the other hand, the difference between sentencing someone to death and his accomplice to life imprisonment is quite noticeable.


 Another fact to take in consideration regarding the death penalty  in Florida is the recent  investigation carried out by the American lawyers college,  which detected serious problems in the  capital penalty; among these are the geographic and racial differences as well as the fact that unanimity is not required in the jury to impose the death penalty as well as the little attention given to mental disability.  Anyway, four members of the jury did not vote for the death penalty on this specific case. 

 

           Due to the above-mentioned reasons Id like to ask for your intervention in the case of Mr. Angel Nieves Daz which is programmed to take place on 13th December of this year.  I honestly hope you could take these reasons in consideration to reevaluate Mr. Angel Diaz case.



 Thank you very much for your attention.


 


                                                          Urgent Action team,


                                                                   Namar

Dear Jeff:
 
Probably you remember me from the activity at the Banker's Club in Puerto Rico in 2002 where we had a great chating.  I was one of the sponsors together with Jerry Pierce Santos. My Wife and I had a great experience talking to you and were amazed by your great domain of Spanish Language and the fact that your wife was Latin American (Mexican).
 
They called me from a newspaper after the activity asking why I donated $10,000.00 then, if I had no interest or business in Florida and I said:  "I believe someone like him is an excellent candidate to represent Latinos in the U.S.," said Peter Diaz Santiago, 33, a Puerto Rico-based attorney who gave $10,000 to the state Republican Party."  October 14, 2002  South Florida Sun-Sentinel.
 
Now I have something to ask you.  Please do not take this wrong, it doesn't mean I am asking for a favor back but anyway, if I have to do it, I will never find a better occassion. 
 
A man will be executed in Christmass time. His name is Angel Nieves.  He claims he is innocent. I do not really know what he did it or not, but I don't think that should be the consideration.
 
Respectfully, the consideration should be that taking his life will show that we are willing to kill too.  You and only you have the Power to stop this execution.
 
Recently, I heard some people talking about the possibility of Latino discrimination and I was amazed because these people don't know that in fact, your Children are Latinos.  So I know for sure that you do not discriminate against us, but probably in the trial process there was discrimination.  My request goes directly to you and the sensibility you possess as a great leader.
 
Stop this execution!  This will be a great Christmass gift for us at the Puerto Rico Bar Association.
 
Thank you, and please say hello to your wife from me and my wife Noemi Rivera.

Monsieur le Gouverneur,





Angel Nieves Diaz doit tre excut en Floride le 13 dcembre 2006. Il a t condamn  mort en 1986 pour le meurtre du grant de bar Joseph Nagy, commis en 1979  Miami lors dun vol  main arme. 


Je voudrais vous exprimer toute la  compassion que je ressens pour la famille de Joseph Nagy et vous faire savoir que je ne cherche pas  minimiser la gravit de ce crime ni les souffrances quil a engendres .


Cependant, je m'oppose  lexcution dAngel Nieves Diaz en prenant acte des lments qui remettent en question son aptitude  tre jug et  assurer lui-mme sa dfense . Des examens mdicaux ont en effet prouv qu'Angel Diaz n'avait pas toute les aptitudes  ncessaires  pour assurer lui-mme  sa dfense.


Je tiens  faire tat de la disparit des peines infliges dans cette affaire, o un accus a t condamn  la rclusion  perptuit et lautre  la peine de mort malgr la prsence de preuves contradictoires quant  qui a tir le coup mortel, et  vous  exprimer ma proccupation quant  lutilisation contre Angel Diaz du tmoignage dun codtenu, type de dposition bien connu pour son manque de fiabilit .

 
J'aimerais qu'il soit tenu compte du fait que quatre des jurs nont pas vot en faveur de la condamnation  mort.

Une tude rcente a mis au jour de graves problmes en ce qui concerne le systme dapplication de la peine capitale en Floride tels que les disparits raciales et gographiques dans lapplication de ce chtiment et le fait que lunanimit du jury nest pas requise pour la dtermination de la peine . 

 
C'est pourquoi je vous demande instamment, Monsieur le gouverneur d' empcher cette excution.
 
Veuillez croire, Monsieur le Gouverneur,  ma haute considration.

Subject:	Nuevas pruebas en contra de la ejecucin de ngel N. Daz

Seor Gobernador de Florida Jeb Bush.

No s si le llegara, pues no he recibido contestacin ni acuse de recibo, pero el da 27 de noviembre le envi un e-mail comentndole mi gran preocupacin sobre la situacin de ngel Nieves Daz, condenado a la pena de muerte cuya ejecucin est prevista para el prximo da 13 de diciembre.

Como le comentaba en mi e-mail, no quiero restar importancia a la gravedad del crimen que se cometi contra la vida de Joseph Nagy y comparto plnamente el sufrimiento que ese hecho ha causado a la familia de la vctima. Pero, como usted puede comprobar, las circunstancias en las que se llev a cabo el juicio de ngel Daz as como las pruebas que llevaron al jurado a tomar la decisin de condenarlo a la pena capital, son de dudosa fiabilidad.  

Conociendo todas las circunstancias, no puedo sino reiterarle mi tajante oposicin a la ejecucin de ngel Nieves Daz. 

 

Aparte de todas las seales que indican que ngel N. Daz no tena capacidad para llevar a cabo su propia defensa (problemas mentales diagnosticados posteriormente, barreras culturales y lingsticas y un nulo conocimiento del sistema judicial) le recuerdo la disparidad de las condenas en este caso, en el que un acusado ha recibido una pena de cadena perpetua (ngel Toro) y el otro una condena de muerte, pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quin fue el autor de los disparos.

Por otro lado, y ms grave an si cabe, es el hecho de que parece ser que la condena de culpabilidad de ngel Daz se decidi fundamentalmente por el testimonio de Ralph Gajus (informador bajo custodia).

Ralph Gajus ha realizado ahora una declaracin jurada en la que manifiesta que su testimonio en el juicio fue falso, que ngel Daz nunca le dijo que fuera el autor de los disparos y que no saba por sus comunicaciones con Daz quin haba disparado a Joseph Nagy. Afirma que su testimonio en el juicio fue motivado por la furia contra ngel Daz y por un deseo de obtener el favor de la fiscala en su propio caso de asesinato. En el juicio, Ralph Gajus haba declarado que no le haban prometido nada a cambio de su testimonio. Sin embargo, en la vista de determinacin de la pena de su caso un polica haba testificado sobre la ayuda que Gajus haba prestado a la fiscala en el caso de Daz.

 

Durante las deliberaciones del jurado en el juicio de ngel Daz, los miembros del jurado pidieron copias del testimonio de Ralph Gajus, pero el juez se neg a proporcionrselas, y dio instrucciones de que el jurado se basara en su recuerdo de lo que el testigo haba dicho. El jurado emiti un veredicto de culpabilidad. La retractacin de Ralph Gajus pone an ms en duda la fiabilidad de este veredicto.

 

Aunque el jurado recomend la pena de muerte para ngel Daz, lo hizo por nicamente ocho votos contra cuatro, lo que indica una posible duda residual en la mente de los miembros del jurado incluso con el testimonio de Ralph Gajus. Sin l, es posible que ms miembros del jurado hubieran votado contra la pena de muerte.

 

La Comisin de California sobre la Administracin Imparcial de Justicia ha emitido recientemente su recomendacin sobre el uso de testimonios de informadores. La Comisin, establecida por el Senado de California para examinar las causas de las condenas errneas y formular recomendaciones para garantizar una administracin imparcial y fiable de la justicia penal en el estado, ha recomendado que la Cmara de Representantes adopte una ley que prohba el uso en juicios penales de testimonios de informadores bajo custodia si no existen pruebas o testimonios independientes que los corroboren.

 

Un estudio realizado recientemente bajo los auspicios del Proyecto de Aplicacin de la Suspensin de la Pena de Muerte, del Colegio Estadounidense de Abogados, identific serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos el elevado ndice de personas excarceladas del corredor de la muerte tras demostrarse su inocencia (22 desde 1973: ms que en Illinois, donde dio lugar a una suspensin de las ejecuciones), la existencia continuada de disparidades raciales y geogrficas, el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad en el jurado para imponer la pena y el hecho de que no se da peso suficiente a los efectos atenuantes de la discapacidad mental grave.

 

Como le comentaba en mi e-mail, tengo un gran cario a su pas. Mi padre, mi madrastra y dos de mis hermanos son americanos. 

No prentendo entrar ahora en un debate sobre la aplicacin de la pena capital o no, no tengo ningn inters poltico ni de otro tipo... Mi nico inters es intentar, dentro de mis limitadas posibilidades, ayudarle a comprender la vital importancia de detener una ejecucin que, por todos los indcios, puede llevar a sesgar la vida de una persona que podra ser inocente.

Desgraciadamente, ha habido demasiados errores ya en la aplicacin de la Pena de Muerte. Errores que tarde o temprano siempre se acaban descubriendo y que, a la vista de sus compatriotas y de la mirada internacional, dan una imagen lamentable del sistema judicial americano. Y lo que es peor... ante condenas de este tipo es imposible devolver la vida al ejecutado y "pedirle perdn".

Es preciso detener la ejecucin de ngel Nieves Daz. 

Confo en el sistema judicial de su pas y en que usted no ser capz de permitir que pueda cometerse una injusticia de este tipo, con tantas pruebas que ponen en duda la sentencia.

Un cordial saludo.

Dear Governor

Angel Nieves Diaz is scheduled for execution in Florida on 13 December 2006. He was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder during a robbery of Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979. First of all I want to express my sympathy for the family of Joseph Nay, who was killed in 1979, and want to explain, that I am not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused. Nevertheless I am opposing the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz. Also I want to note that there are evidence calling into question his competency to stand trial and represent himself. Furthermore I want to note that the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman and I want to express concern at the use of jailhouse information testimony against Angel Nieves Diaz, a notoriously unreliable from testimony. Also I want to mention that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty and that recent research has found serious problems with Floridas capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions. I am calling on You to intervene to stop this execution.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I wrote you a week or so ago to express concern about the case of Angel Diaz who is scheduled to be excecuted on December 13th, 2006 for the murder of Joseph Nagy back in 1979.   Since I wrote you I have learned from Amnesty International that the jailhouse informant used to incriminate Mr Diaz has recanted his testimony.  Since this testimony was crucial in contradicting the testimony of Mr Diaz's girlfriend and two people present when the shooting took place-- all of whom testified that Mr Diaz was not the gunman-- there are even more grounds for reviewing his case and suspending his death sentence.  
 
In addition to this, I remain concerned that evidence of Mr Diaz's competency to stand trial and to represent himself was not available to be considered at his trial.  Also, the prisoner who seems in fact to have been the gunman has been given only a life sentence, while Mr Diaz has been sentenced to death and this seems hardly equitable.  Moreover, even with the perjured testimony of a prison informant, 4 jurors refused to give Mr Diaz a death sentence, suggesting that the case was far from clear-cut.  Finally, there is concern that race played a role in securing the conviction. 
 
I want to reiterate what I said in my earlier letter.  I lost my own nephew at the age of 18 and no something of the pain of  the senseless death of a family member.  I have nothing but empathy for the suffering of Joseph Nagy's family and friends.  They are entitled to see justice done and there is no excusing his shooting.  My concern is that in executing Mr Diaz justice will not be served.  And so I implore you, once again, to please intervene and suspend the execution of Mr Diaz.
 
Thank you for considering my views.  I would appreciate any response you may care to share with me.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am a professor of philosophy at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Canada.  I have a strong interest in human rights issues in Canada and around the world and an active member of Amnesty International which, as you no doubt know, is a non-partisan human rights agency.  

 

I am writing to express concern about the case of Angel Nieves Diaz who is scheduled for execution on December 13, 2006 having been convicted in 1986 of murdering Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979.  Having suffered through the death of a nephew, I have the utmost empathy for Mr Nagys family and friends.  Theirs is the sort of suffering that does not end and they are, of course, entitled to see justice done.  However, the information I have received makes me very worried that justice has not been served in the case of Mr Diaz.

 

In the first place, there is a substantial body of evidence to suggest he was not competent to stand trial and should not have been allowed to represent himself including the testimony of the lawyer charged to defend him and mental health assessments conducted after his trial. This evidence seems to have been disregarded to date. 

 

Second, the other accused person in this case, Mr. Angel Toro, pled guilty to the crime in exchange for a life sentence.  It is hard to justify a more severe sentence for Mr Diaz when there are no eye-witnesses to the shooting of Mr Nagy and conflicting evidence as to who fired the fatal shot.   (Two people in the bar testified that it was Mr. Toro, not Mr Diaz, who shot Joseph Nagy.)

 

Third, the evidence against Mr Diaz included testimony by inmates.  Study after study has shown such testimony to be unreliable.

 

Fourth, the American Bar Association has noted significant racial disparities in sentences in Florida courts.  (Mr Diaz is Puerto Rican and was forced to wear shackles throughout the trial, despite research findings suggesting this is prejudicial.)  The same report cites the failure in Florida courts to give due consideration to mental disabilities as mitigating factors in crime.  (Mr. Diaz is a victim of child abuse and has a record of mental problems.)  

 

Finally, notwithstanding all of the above, four jurors were against the sentence of death in this case.  I might add, as you know, the American Bar Association has also expressed concern that unanimity among jurors is not required in death penalty cases in Florida.

 

I have a different view of the death penalty than you do but this is not the issue I am raising here.  The issue here is whether the trial and sentencing of Mr Diaz meets the standards of justice the United States holds itself to and of which it is rightly proud.  It seems to me there is ample evidence this is not the case.  In light of this, I implore you to intervene and stop the execution of Mr Diaz on December 13th, 2006.

 

I would appreciate any further information you may have about this case.  Thank you for considering my concerns.

Dear Governor, 

 

I am writing to you in the name of Amnesty International, France. Through this organization, I have learned of the imminent execution, scheduled for December 13, 2006, of  Angel Nieves Diaz for the 1979 murder of  Joseph Nagy in Miami.

 

First I want to express my sympathy for the family and friends of Joseph Nagy and in no way do I seek to condone the crime that led to this tragic death or to minimize the suffering caused. However, I am opposed to the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz. 

 

Two mental experts concluded that Angel Diaz suffers from certain mental disorders which contributed to his decision to represent himself and undermined his ability to do so competently. I do not believe he adequately understood the legal system and the conduct of the trial due to cultural differences and language barriers, among other reasons.

 

In this case there is a disparity in sentencing the case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman, and I am therefore expressing concern at the use of jailhouse informant testimony against Angel Dial, a notoriously unreliable form of testimony. Besides 4 of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty. 

 

I also want to draw your attention to the fact that recent research has found serious problems with Floridas capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions.

 

I therefore appeal to you Governor Bush to stop the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz.  Moreover I urge you to lend your full support for a moratorium of executions in the state of  Florida.

 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this grave matter

Dear Governor:

I have just been informed that a key prosecution witness at the 1985 trial 
of Angel Nieves Diaz has recanted his testimony, which had been a key part 
of the evidence that convicted Diaz of murder.

I do of course know that he was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder 
during a robbery of bar manager Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979. Thus, please 
note that my present letter does of course not pretend to justify the 
violent death suffered by him. I would even appreciate being able to send my 
most sincere condolences to their relatives.

However, as this new information is calling into further doubt the 
reliability of the jurys verdict, calling into further doubt the 
reliability of the jurys verdict, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU to intervene and 
stop this execution, also noting that four of the jurors did not even vote 
for the death penalty before, indicating a possible residual doubt in their 
minds about the defendants guilt. Thus, let me suggest that without the 
testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death 
sentence

Hoping that you will be able to consider my request at your very earliest 
convenience, I look forward to receiving a favorable reply and remain

Sincerely yours

Ante la abundancia de dudas en su juicio, la inhabilidad mental de la que 
parece sufrir y de la revocacin del testimonio aportado por el preso que 
acus al seor Daz, son motivos ms que suficientes para detener la 
ejecucin. Desde el apoyo ms sincero a la familia del asesinado, pido por

a pena de muerte que no plantea nada ms que dudas morales y ticas a parte 
de un nulo efecto regenerador en la sociedad. Por favor espero lean el mail

Sr Gobernador:

Me dirijo a usted respecto al tema de la condena de ngen Nieves Daz puesto 
que me llena de gran perocupacin. Conocido es el inters de su pas y la 
lucha por los derechos humanos, por lo cual estoy seguro de que entendern 
el motivo de mi escrito.

Me he informado de los hechos ocurridos ocurridos en Miami el 13 de 
diciembre de 2006, los cuales me han conmocionado profundamente y lamento y 
condeno el fallecimiento de Joseph Nagy y envo todo mi apoyo a la familia 
del mismo. Del mismo modo que con mi peticin no intento ni muchos restar 
importancia al hecho acontedido.

Debo indicar que me opongo totalmente a la ejecucin de dicho preso, puesto 
que se han sucedido una serie de hechos irregulares en su proceso de 
condena. Las pruebas y su propia testificacin daban indicios de que ngel 
Toro era el autor material de disparo, pero se le cambi la pena capital por 
cadena perpetua. Tras la solicitud de ngel Nieves Daz de realizar su 
propia defensa, la cual fue aprobada por el juez, se le hicieron ms pruebas 
a posteriori en las que se demostr que no estaba capacitado para tal labor. 
Es ms, en su sano juicio y tras dos meses de preparacin de la defensa con 
un abogado, nadie sugirira tal accin sin conocer el idioma del pas 
(ingls) y sin nociones legislativas del lugar.

As mismo, el testimonio acusador en contra del susodicho preso, provenan 
de una fuente poco fiable, un informador encarcelado.

Destacar tambin que cuatro de los miembros del jurado votaron en contra de 
su pena de muerte.

Tambin debo indicar los serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la 
pena de muerte detectados en Florida, por disparidad racial, geogrfica o el 
no ser necesaria la unanimidad del jurado para la imposicin de la pena. Sin 
juzgar la necesidad o no de dicha pena, cabe decir que es la nica no 
enmendable del cdigo penal estadounidense y aquellos que los juzgan y 
condenan tambin son humanos y cometen errores, pero estos ya no tienen 
vuelta atrs tras la ejecucin de un inocente.

As pues, ruego al Sr gobernador de Florida, el seor Jeb Bush conmute la 
pena de muerte al acusado ngel Nieves Daz por aquella que crean ms 
apropiada sin llegar a la pena capital.

Confiando en su buen juicio y valoracin de la justicia y derechos del 
hombre, espero tengan en cuenta la solicitud y actuen de una manera 
clemente.

Esperando recibir una pronta respuesta, acepten un sincero saludo.

Me dirijo nuevamente a usted alarmado por la ejecucin de ejecucin de ngel Nieves Daz, prevista en su estado para el prximo da 13 de diciembre, despus de que Ralph Gajus, testigo de cargo fundamental en el juicio, se ha retractado de su testimonio contra ngel Daz.

Ralph Gajus ha realizado ahora una declaracin jurada en la que manifiesta que su testimonio en el juicio fue falso, que ngel Daz nunca le dijo que fuera el autor de los disparos y que no saba por sus comunicaciones con Daz quin haba disparado a Joseph Nagy. Afirma que su testimonio en el juicio fue motivado por la furia contra ngel Daz y por un deseo de obtener el favor de la fiscala en su propio caso de asesinato. Cuatro de los miembros del jurado no votaron a favor de la pena de muerte, y sin el testimonio de Ralph Gajus, es posible que ms miembros del jurado hubieran votado contra la condena de muerte. La ex novia de ngel Daz y otras dos personas, que estaban en el bar en el momento del robo, indicaron que ngel Daz no haba sido el autor de los disparos. Incluso, en un memorndum, el fiscal escribi: " El acusado Toro dispar contra Nagy una vez en el pecho, causndole la muerte".


La investigacin llevada a cabo por la Northwestern University de Illinois ha demostrado que los testimonios prestados por personas que se encuentran bajo custodia o se enfrentan a procesamientos penales son frecuentemente poco fiables.
Me preocupa tambin la reciente investigacin ha detectado serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos la existencia de disparidades geogrficas y raciales y el elevado ndice de personas excarceladas del "corredor de la muerte" tras demostrarse su inocencia, 22 desde 1973. Penselo bien por que en este caso no habra marcha atrs y la reputacin de Florida se perjudicara a nivel internacional.

Le insto a que intervenga urgentemente para detener esta ejecucin. Le pido que conmute la pena de muerte a Angel Diaz Nieves por un castigo mas humano.
Si luego se demuestra su inocencia la vergenza ser grande y tendr que vivir con el remordimiento.
 
En espera de respuesta me despido atentamente.

Governor Jeb Bush

Dear Governor

Thank you for to pay attention to my letter. I write this letter to him to
express my preoccupation. Angel Nieves Diaz is scheduled for execution in
Florida on 13 December 2006. He was sentenced to death in 1986 for the
murder during a robbery of bar manager Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979.

I want to make notice my solidarity with Joseph Nagy and family; I try
neither excuse the crime that cost your life nor to minimize the sufferings
caused to his familiy.

But I am set against the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz. I believe that the
single human life is of God. In addition it is necessary to consider the
tragic history of the defendant and his mental problems. The development of
the process demonstrates its incapacity to be judged and to defend itself to
itself.

A key prosecution witness at the 1985 trial of Angel Nieves Diaz has
recanted his testimony, which had been a key part of the evidence that
convicted Diaz of murder. On 27 November, lawyers for Angel Diaz filed a new
motion in court on the basis of this new evidence

A defendant has received a sentence of life imprisonment and other one a
penalty of death, in spite of the contradictory testimonies of the one who
was the author of the shots; in addition, against ngel Daz has considered
the testimony of a jailed informer, a slightly trustworthy testimony. Four
of the members of the jury did not vote in favour of the capital punishment.

I go to you, dear governor, to supplicate him that it takes part to stop
this execution.
Please, dear Governor, stop this execution and you grant I pardon to Angel
Nieves Diaz.
Please, in the name of God, compassion and pity.
Please, please, thank you, please.

Although not in any way seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused

*	the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite there being conflicting evidence about who was the gunman;  
*	that Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against Angel Diaz.
*	We also call into further doubt the reliability of the jury's verdict; in particular  the fact hat four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty, indicating a possible residual doubt in their minds about the defendant's guilt, and suggest that without the testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence;


W also draw your attention to the  recent research has found serious problems with Florida's capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions.

Dear Mr. Davis: 

Thank you for responding so quickly. I am so sorry for the misunderstanding,
I don't expect anyone to make my legal problem go away as I except full
responsiblity for my poor choices that night. The help I was asking for is
in the event these issues aren't resolved that whatever punishment I receive
will allow me to maintain my employment, as I provide the main financial
support for my mother and I, and continue my college education.

Dear Mr. Katterhenry:

Thank you for your letter to Governor Bush.  He asked me to respond.

As you may know, the decision to charge a person for crimes is made by the
state attorney, a locally elected official.  Deciding whether or not to
charge a person is based on the best interests of justice and on the
quantity and quality of the evidence of criminal activity.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that
should be resolved through the court system.  If you believe a person is
innocent, or not guilty of all charges, you may wish to obtain the services
of an attorney experienced in criminal defense. If you need assistance in
locating an attorney, please call the Florida Bar's Referral Service at
1-800-342-8011.  

Those who are facing criminal charges for which prison time is a
possibility, may be appointed an attorney by the court.  For further
assistance in this regard, please contact the office of your locally elected
public defender.  Please be sure the attorney is provided with all of the
evidence you believe shows innocence.

The Governor trusts justice will be served in this case.

I know you probably get e-mails from dump teenagers all the time but this
dump teenager really needs your help. 

I am a full time student at FCCJ and I work full time so I don't have much
of a social life but on October 29, 2006 I went to a Halloween party/class
reunion so I decided to go since I hadn't seen these people since
graduation. I drank a few beers which was the first stupid thing I did and
started to feel sick so I decided to head home.   I wasn't familiar with the
area of town I was in so I obviously missed my turn and continued down
Monument Road which I lead to the base housing entrance of  Mayport Naval
Base. I drove past the guard house thinking it was a gated community and
within a minute or two there was a vehicle following me with blue lights on,
I panicked and kept going thinking it was security for the neighborhood but
if I stopped they might smell the beer and I would be in big trouble if they
called my mom so I was hoping I could find the road out but I tried to turn
around and they blocked me so I turned my car off and they pulled me out and
handcuffed me. They called the Jacksonville Sheriff's office to come and
bring me to jail and 

I take full responsibility for my actions that night and whatever punishment
that comes with it. My biggest concern is being able to keep my job and
continue my college education. My job requires that I have a vehicle as I am
responsible for 3 shopping centers and have to be available to get to one of
them quickly in the event of an emergency like a lighting or plumbing
problem which affects the safety or security of our tenants. Also, my income
is almost twice what my mother's is and I provide the majority of our
financial support.  I had a 1982 Gran Fury Salon that my grandmother gave me
that I had been restoring but I sold it to pay my brother back the $500 he
loaned me to post bail, so I am realizing how expensive bad decisions can
be.  

I am a student at FCCJ majoring in Psychology I've never been a 4.0 student
but I do my best. I work full time for Equity One in property maintenance
and they allow me to work my hours around my class schedule.  I live at home
with my mother who has some problems with her health but since it's just the
two of us we are very close.  Other than work and school I am at home most
of the time studying or working on the computer. Partying is definitely not
a priority to me. I have one friend outside of my family members and we
usually just watch sports on TV or go out to see a movie once or twice a
month. That's about the extent of my social life. 

I can't explain why I acted the way I did that night as Chief Steve
Weintraub of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office pretty much raised me from
junior high through graduation and he instilled in me a respect for the law
and law enforcement officers, he even gave me the opportunity to work
part-time for Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on deployments to find stores
that were selling cigarettes and alcohol to minors. My career goal prior
this incident was to apply to  FBI academy after I graduated from college, I
was in the process of  completing an essay on law enforcement careers for my
English class when this incident happen. In addition to that, my grandfather
was in the Navy for 22 years and if he were still alive he would be furious
with me for my disrespectful behavior towards the military. I am treated for
anxiety disorder and my doctor had just put me on a new antidepressant and
mixing it with alcohol was obviously not a smart thing to do.

I'm  not asking to get out of any punishment I have coming to me, just some
help in keeping my job and continuing to work towards my college degree. 

I am not a bad person and most people refer to me as a geek nevertheless I
did make some really stupid decisions that night. 


Thank you for your time.

Dear Governor,

I am writing to you as a member of Amnesty International.

I sympathize for the family of Joseph Nagy, who was killed in 1979, and I am not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused;

I oppose the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, please note evidence calling into question his competency to stand trial and represent himself;

Please note the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman;

Please note that Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against Angel Diaz, calling into further doubt the reliability of the jury's verdict;

Please note that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty, indicating a possible residual doubt in their minds about the defendant's guilt, and suggesting that without the testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence;

Please note that recent research has found serious problems with Florida's capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions;

I ask you Governor to intervene to stop this execution.

Thank you for your time in this urgent matter.

Warm Regards,

Dear Governor,

I 

am a Computer Scientist born in Spain, educated in Great Britain and resident for the last 7 years in Greece. Human rights is one of my greatest concerns and that is why I have been given details by International Amnesty about the ANGEL DIAZ case. 

First of all, I need

to express my condolences and support to Joseph Nagy's family, murdered in 1979. Without resting importance to the terrible crime committed and to all of the suffering caused by it I feel the execution of Angel Diaz is against Human Rights and call for the sentence to be commuted. 

The main reason for this request is the unfair trial he went through, without a proper defence lawyer and being obvious that he was not capable to represent himself .

The actual killer of Joseph Nagy, who did have a proper representation, had a less severe sentence while Angel Diaz received the maximum sentence. It does look like he is being made guilty based on the single testimony of the informer in prison. This testimony is by all means not reliable. 

Moreover, four members of the jury did not consider ANGEL DIAZ guilty of murdering Joseph Nagy but still the decision of making him pay for this crime was made. It has been proved in numerous occasions that the SYSTEM for applying death penalty in Florida FAILS. You would agree that this is a very serious matter where there should not be room for mistakes. How many innocent people are to be executed until Florida changes its system to a unanimous vote from the jury. 

Prejudices against other races, social levels and even beliefs are excuses used by many, everywhere, for violence and discrimination. Unfortunately, prejudices are also an excuse used by some for taking a person's life. Progress and civilization are supposed to be guardians of Human Rights. 

I am asking your Excellency to have a more progressed and civilized Florida. Please, stop ANGEL DIAZ's execution. The eyes of people who care about Human Rights all over the world are today on you.

Yours Sincerely

Dear Governor

Ich wende mich an Sie in der Angelegenheit von Angel Nieves Diaz.
Amnesty international hat mich informiert, dass beabsichtigt ist, diesen Mann am 13. Dezember hinrichten zu lassen.

Ich versichere Ihnen, dass ich die Trauer und das Leid der Angehoerigen und Freunde von  Joseph Nagy nachempfinden und verstehen kann. Ich will die schreckliche Tat in keiner Weise entschuldigen oder herunterspielen.

Ich wende mich aber  wie Amnesty international - entschieden gegen die Todesstrafe.
 
Im Fall von Angel Nieves Diaz wurde erwiesenermassen in Frage gestellt, ob er die Kompetenz habe, die Gerichtsverhandlung durchzustehen und sich selbst zu verteidigen.
Es ist mir unverstaendlich, warum in diesem Fall der eine Angeklagte zu lebenslanger Haft und der andere zum Tode verurteilt wurde, obschon die Zeugen sich widersprechen, wer der Schuetze gewesen ist.

Ich moechte Sie nochmals darauf aufmerksam machen, dass Ralph Gajus, ein Hauptbelastungszeuge, jetzt seine Aussage widerrufen hat. Das laesst weitere Zweifel an der Zuverlaessigkeit des Urteils der Jury aufkommen.

Ausserdem hatten vier der Juroren nicht fuer die Todesstrafe gestimmt, da sie Zweifel an der Schuld des Angeklagten hatten. Ohne die Zeugenaussage von Ralph Gajus haetten sich moeglicherweise noch mehr der Geschworenen gegen die Todesstrafe ausgesprochen.

Neueste Untersuchungen haben schwerwiegende Probleme in Floridas oberstem Justizwesen aufgezeigt. So gibt es geografische und rassenspezifische Unterschiede und ein Mangel an Voraussetzungen fr die Einstimmigkeit des Urteils der Geschworenen.

Ich bitte Sie dringend, das alles zu bedenken und die Exekution von Angel Nieves Diaz zu stoppen. 

Hochachtungsvoll gruesst Sie

Dear Governor 

 RE:  Angel Nieves Diaz

 I understand that Angel Nieves Diaz is still due to be executed on December 13th for the murder of Joseph Nagy in 1979.

 While I feel deep sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy and in no way wish to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused I do none the less oppose the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, both because I oppose any use of the death penalty and because his competency to stand trial and represent himself seems deeply questionable.

I understand that there was a major disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another a death sentence, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman. I am also very concerned by the use of jailhouse informant testimony against Angel Diaz in this case as it is a notoriously unreliable form of testimony.

Moreover, Ralph Gajus, the key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony  which calls the reliability of the jurys verdict into further question.

I also note that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty and that recent research has found serious problems with Florida's capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions.

I therefore call on you, Mr Governor, to intervene to stop this execution.

Subject:	RE: APPEAL

Dear Warren Davis,

 

Many thanks for your speedy reply. Since the sending of my mail to Governor Bush I have learned that a key prosecution witness at the 1985 trial of Angel Nieves Diaz has recanted his testimony, which had been a key part of the evidence that convicted Diaz of murder.  On 27 November, lawyers for Angel Diaz filed a new motion in court on the basis of this new evidence.  Ralph Gajus has now provided a sworn affidavit stating that his testimony at the trial was false; that Angel Diaz never told him that he was the gunman; and that he did not know from his communication with Diaz who had shot Joseph Nagy.  He states that his testimony to the contrary was motivated by anger at Angel Diaz and a desire to gain favour from the state on his own murder charge.  Ralph Gajus had testified at the trial that he had not been promised anything in return for his testimony.  However, at his own sentencing a police officer had testified about the assistance Gajus had provided to the state in the Diaz case. 

During the jury's deliberations at the trial of Angel Diaz, the jurors requested copies of the testimony of Ralph Gajus, but the judge refused, instructing the jury to rely on its recollection of what he had said. The jury returned a guilty verdict.  Ralph 
Gajus's recantation further calls into question the reliability of their verdict. 

Although the jury recommended a death sentence for Angel Diaz, they did so only by eight votes to four, indicating possible residual doubt in the minds of the jurors even with the testimony of Ralph Gajus.  Without it, it is possible that more of the jurors would have voted against a death sentence.

 

Given these serious doubts as to the efficacy of this sentence I call on the Governor to intervene to stop this execution.

 

Many thanks for your assistance in this matter

Subject: RE: APPEAL

 

 

Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush about a death row inmate.  The Governor appreciates your  concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.

 

Governor Bush believes that the death penalty is appropriate and warranted in certain capital murder cases, and supports its use by the courts in those cases.  The Governor also believes we should look not only to the issues surrounding the defendant, but also to the surviving victims, and to the effect the murder has on our community as a whole, in deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment.

 

Florida law provides numerous levels of appeals for the convicted individual before the sentence is moved.  Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.  No other state has invested the public resources in capital post conviction legal representation that Florida has been providing for well over a decade. 

 

Governor Bush shares the concerns of many that the death penalty must be reserved for only the most heinous cases.  As the Governor has said many times, the signing of a death warrant is one of the most solemn and somber responsibilities he must undertake, and he does so with humble deliberation.

 

Again, thank you for taking the time to write about this very serious issue.

 

Sincerely,

This communication has the purpose to request your intervention to save the life of the Puerto Rican national ngel Nieves Daz, who was sentenced to death by this State of Florida over twenty years ago, and at this time is waiting to be executed.  You have ordered ngel's execution for this December the 13th.  All judicial appellate procedures have been exhausted.  
 
I am firmly opposed to the application of the death penalty.  The circumstances of this case deserve your immediate intervention.  There are plenty of reasons that convince me that prompt action has to be taken.  Among those reasons, we have to consider the age of ngel and the long time that Mr. Nieves Daz has been imprisoned -taking into account the terrible confinement circumstances of being in death row-.  Besides, a series of anomalies were observed in the judicial process, raising serious doubts about the fairness of the judicial process and even over the guilty verdict in Angel's case.  I humbly, but firmly request of you the immediate commutation of the death penalty for Mr. Nieves Daz.  In the alternative, we request a moratorium of the execution until all aspects of the case can be cleared, including further DNA tests.  
 
Sincerely,

November 29th 2006

Dear Governor:

With deep consternation I have heard of the sad news that Angel Nieves Diaz 
is scheduled for execution in Florida on December 13th 2006.

I do of course know that he was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder 
during a robbery of bar manager Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979. Thus, please 
note that my present letter does of course not pretend to justify the 
violent death suffered by him. I would even appreciate being able to send my 
most sincere condolences to their relatives.

However, let me also point you out the disparity in sentencing in this case, 
with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite 
conflicting evidence about who was the gunman. I would like to remind you 
that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty and that recent 
research has found serious problems with Florida&#8217;s capital justice 
system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a 
requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions.

For the reasons I have exposed, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU to intervene and 
stop this execution.

Hoping that you will be able to consider my request at your very earliest 
convenience, I look forward to receiving a favorable reply and remain

Sincerely yours
Signed:

- je fais remarquer quune tude rcente a mis au jour de graves problmes en ce qui concerne le systme dapplication de la peine capitale en Floride tels que les disparits raciales et gographiques dans lapplication de ce chtiment et le fait que lunanimit du jury nest pas requise pour la dtermination de la peine ; 

- enfin je vous exhorte, Monsieur le Gouverneur,  empcher cette excution.

               Je formule ma demande dans le seul souci de respecter et de faire respecter les Droits de la Personne Humaine et sur recommandation dAmnesty International qui est une organisation apolitique et non confessionnelle.

Thank you for your prompt reply.  I still don't think that any of you understand that nothing is being done due to lack of willingness.  I have not been able to present any evidence in reference to my allegations since no one seems to care, that is precisely the problem.  If after investigating my allegations someone, anyone, would tell me that maybe I was reading into things or that there was not enough evidence to proceed I would have been satisfied, however, every time I speak with someone they tell me it's not their job.
 
As far as the EEOC, of course I will follow the matter however, they will not be able to prosecute Fleming due to his fabrication of evidence or falsification of official records, that at this time is one of my main concerns, which obviously does not seem to matter to many.

Governor Jeb Bush <Jeb.Bush@MyFlorida.com> wrote:

Dear Ms. Peppin:

Thank you for your writing again to Governor Bush. It was my pleasure to speak with you recently regarding your concerns about your termination from employment and your allegations of misconduct by your employer, the Flagler County Sheriff's Department. Governor Bush asked me to respond in this regard.

As we discussed, the Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in civil and criminal court cases. It was my understanding you spoke with attorneys and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That was the appropriate thing to do. I encourage you to work with legal counsel to resolve your concerns in this regard.

I also understand you spoke with the state attorney's office. Each state attorney is an elected official charged with certain discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether to prosecute any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction. This decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt shown, and in the best interest of justice. 

For further assistance, you may wish to contact the Ethics Commission. That address is Post Office Drawer 15709, Tallahassee, Florida, 32317-5709, and the telephone number is (850) 488-7864.

Thank you again for writing. The Governor is sorry you were dissatisfied with the way this office has responded and wishes we could be of further assistance. Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.


Sincerely,



Warren Davis

I sent a letter to Mr. Adams, and I also spoke with someone in your office, who suggested that I follow up with State Attorney Harry Shortstein, to see whether or not he was going to investigate the allegations made by myself against the Sheriff's Office of Flagler County and Sheriff Fleming. I was horrified to speak with this man, yes he did answer the phone and tried to be very polite, however, as a politician he explained that even though Mr. Adams had sent him a copy of the letter that I was referring to, he was not able to do anything about it since he did not feel he had the power to do. When I asked him if he felt that I was mislead or lied to, of course he replied "No", but I cannot do what they are saying I can. 

All I ever asked for was justice, and yes, I may be not have been born in this country however, I am not stupid, the only one that can intervene at this time is the Governor, I would prefer to be told he chooses not to, than to be continuesly sent on a wild goose chase. My unemployment has run out, I have no way to earn any monies, please note that I have worked in this country since I was 13 yoa, therefore, I am not asking for anything other than what I feel should be mine, a fair look into this case, and the right to earn a living, which I cannot do, since the Sheriff has fabricated evidence against me and falsefied official records, something else that Mr. Shortstein feels is not a criminal matter only a civil matter, I now have a better understanding as to why our judicial system doesn't work specially when our State Attorneys are not sure of the law.

At this time I know the governor refuses to do anything, but let me just see if I get this straight, Sheriff Fleming falsefies an official report by fabricating evidence, and this is only a civil matter, and not enough for the Governor to get involved, this on top of everything and every other problem Fleming is facing. Please enlighten me and tell me when will the Governor take a stand; when Fleming keeps falsifying official records to cover up his incompetence or he destroys the county is supposed to serve.

I hope you had a good holiday, since we could not afford one, and obviously our Christmas don't look any better. I hope yours is better.

Dear Governor,


Amnesty International submitted a second report of Angel Nieves Diaz.



Again I call on you to commute the death sentence of Angel Nieves Diaz who is scheduled for execution on 13 December 2006. I want to note that Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against Angel Nieves Diaz. Furthermore I want to note that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty. Maybe there is a residual doubt in their minds about the defendants guilt.


Dear Governor, I still want to explain that I am not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused, but I call on you to stop the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz.


I thank you for your attention to this important matter.


Yours sincerely,
Martin Jans

Dear Mr. Davis, 
                         Let me start off by saying I hope you had a
great holiday.  I think the Governor got the wrong impression about my
original e-mail.  I realize he can not get involved personally, although
I do  appreciate his concern.  I was just wanting someone to point me in
the right direction on how I can get before congress or who ever to
maybe get  stituations like this clarified.  I do understand that Judges
do make decissions based on the information they are presented, but the
information presented in this case was false.  I just don't want this
situation to happen to another child or family.    It is not necessay
that you reply unless you can point me in the right direction.  Do I try
to contact my Staste representive or what.

Sincerly,

Dear Ms. Rowe:

Thank you for your recent e-mail to Governor Bush requesting assistance
with a child custody matter.  He has asked me to respond.

Custody and visitation rulings are under the jurisdiction of the
judicial system.  Under Florida law, the court's decision in these cases
is based on the best interest of the child or children involved.  Judges
review all of the information presented to them and apply the law to
make their decision.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters
that should be resolved through the court system.  If you are unhappy
with a ruling or feel a case has not been handled according to the law,
you should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be
available.  For those unable to afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services
or the county legal aid association has information about the
availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone number of Florida
Legal Services is (850) 385-7900.  Those dissatisfied with their
representatives should consider choosing another attorney.

Of course, should you suspect a child is in any danger, notify your
local law enforcement or the Department of Children and Families' hot
line, 1-800-96-ABUSE.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the
problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance. 
Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.

Sincerely,



Warren Davis
Office of Citizens' Services

Dear Governor Bush,
                              My name is Patricia Rowe and I would like
your help, if you are able to assist.  My situation is unusual but not
too uncommon in today's society.  This is a long letter but I hope you
will take the time to read this letter.  I will try to make it as short
as I can.  On 11-22-96 my neice Michelle Lynn Hoffman gave birth to a
baby girl named Elin .  Michelle and Elin's birth father were not
married.  On 12-27-98 Michelle passed away.  In  June of 2000 my sister
and her husband, Michelle's step-father and Elin's step-grand-father
adopted Elin.  In July 0f 2000 my sister and her husband seperated.  In
November of 2000 my sister, Elin, and my nephew came to live with my
boys and I.  They lived with me until April of 2002, at which time my
sister and her children moved out of my house and moved in to a home of
their own.  On June 13th, 2002 my sister took her life and Elin and my
nephew came back to live with my boys and I.   Elin lived with me until
June of 2004.  My nephew had move out in 2002 as he had turned 18 and
moved out of state.  In June of 2004, Elin's adopted father had found
out he had cancer and asked to have Elin for the summer so he could
spend time with her.  He had gotten remarried. ( He was 64 and his wife
was 65, and Elin at this time was 7.)  He assured me that he would bring
Elin back to me in the fall as he knew Elin had been adopted back into
the family to stay with the family, after all we are her maternal blood
family.  In July of 2004 my family,(my mom, my nephew ) and I went to
see a family law attorney to find out if we had any rights to Elin.  We
were told that as long as her adopted father was alive he did not have
to let us see her because he was her legal parent, but that if he died
we could get her back.  I asked the attorney if he could have his new
wife adopt Elin and the attorney said no, not with out oour permission
because we were her blood family.  Elin's adopted father passed away the
day afterThanksgiving in 2005, and my family and I went to an attorney
to get Elin back.  At   that time we found out that Elin was adopted by
her step-mother.  We tried to have the adoption over turned, but that
was not a success, as the Judge that handled the adoption retired in
Febuary of 2006.  The new Judge would not over turn the adoption.  The
petition for the adoption had errors and misrepresentations.  The main
one being that her adopted father said he was the biological
grand-father and made no mention of Elin having other biological
relatives that had an interest in her.  
So my question is how do I get laws clarified or changed so that this
type situation does not happen to another child or family.  In my
oppinion this is legalized kidnapping.

Thank you for any help you can give me.  If you have any questions
please call @ (352)316-4240.

Sencerly, 
Patricia L.Rowe

Dear Sirs,

	REF:	Angel Nieves Diaz 

I am writing to you as a British citizen and as a member of Amnesty International. I am most concerned about the impending execution of Angel Nieves Diaz on the grounds that he may have been incorrectly sentenced, another error of the capital justice system in the USA, which i personally oppose (although I am not an American citizen, so please excuse me). A key prosecution witness at the 1985 trial of Angel Nieves Diaz has recanted his testimony, which had been a key part of the evidence that convicted Diaz of murder.  On 27 November, lawyers 
for Angel Diaz filed a new motion in court on the basis of this new evidence.  

I wish to express sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy, who was killed in 1979, and wish to explain that I am not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused; I oppos the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, noting evidence calling into question his competency to stand trial and represent himself; I note the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman; I note that Ralph Gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against Angel Diaz, calling into further doubt the reliability of the jury's verdict; I note that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty, indicating a possible residual doubt in their minds about the defendant's guilt, and suggesting that without the testimony of Ralph Gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence; I also note that recent research has found serious problems with Florida's capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions;

Finally, I call on the Governor to intervene to stop this execution. 

I look forward to any reply you care to make.


Regards,

	Douglas John Birbeck.

Dear Governor Bush,

Its even more remote a chance now, surely, that you could sanction the execution of Angel Diaz, now that Ralph Gajus has retracted. Clearly, even more of the jurors would have voted against the death sentence if theyd known.
Please dont let Floridas judicial reputation be tarnished even further, and intervene to stop this execution.

  Sr. Gobernador:
 
  Me dirijo a usted expresando en primer lugar mi oposicin a cualquier acto de violencia de la ndole que sea, as como expresando mi apoyo a la familia de Joseph Nagy, asesinado en 1979, en momentos en los que su dolor se recrudece al tener que recordar el episodio fatal ocurrido en aquella fecha, ante la inminente fecha de la ejecucin de la pena capital de Angel Nieves Diaz.
 
  Por otra parte, respecto a dicha condena de pena de muerte, mostrar mi firme conviccin de que ese no es el camino correcto para mostrar a la sociedad que la fuerza del Estado recae sobre las personas que pudieran actuar al margen de la ley en casos de extrema gravedad. Centrandome en el caso concreto de Angel Nieves Daz dudo en primer lugar que ste tuviera la capacidad para poder defenderse a s mismo con las garantas mnimas que el procedimiento requera, y es ms incluso para tener que ser juzgado como principal inculpado por el hecho material de haber disparado contra Joseph Nagy, provocando su muerte.
 
  Sealo aparte, la incongruencia que se muestra en el proceso al haber incluso disparidad de condenas, lo que a mi entender es muestra inequvoca de la poca claridad con la que se vean los hechos por el tribunal competente en el caso, ya que hay que subrayar que mientras Angel Toro fu condenado a cadena perpetua, Angel Nieves lo fu a pena de muerte pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quien fu el autor material de los disparos, y sobre todo findose del testimonio de un informador encarcelado que dijo haber escuchado del condenado a muerte que l haba disparado a Joseph Nagy, testimonio, a mi entender, poco fiable, incluso dira que movido por intereses personales de su compaero de celda para as poder sacar algn beneficio respecto a su condena, opinin, sta, muy personal, pero creo que nunca descabellada a la luz de la lgica ms lgica.
 
  Otro dato que corrobora al rechazo de que Angel Nieves Daz no sea ejecutado es que de los 12 componentes del jurado popular slo 8 lo condenaran, mientras que los 4 restantes no lo consideraron as, disparidad de criterios ante un mismo asunto a la vista, aparte de considerar que NADIE tiene poder para adoptar una medida como ejecutar mediante su voto a otra a la muerte, considero que en juicios de especial gravedad si el mtodo del jurado es el elegido el criterio de una mayora es inaceptable, como ha sido el caso, pero es que ni aunque fuera por unanimidad, e incluso ya en el caso de que fuera un juez quien lo decidiera. Con ste sistema no solo se ve el dolor de la familia del asesinado, ni solo del condenado y sus parientes, sino que esas personas que toman una decisin tan grave y que al final de cuentas hacen que el 16 de Diciembre de 2006 se pueda haber matado a una persona amparndose en las reglas del juego del Estado de Derecho.
 
  Sealar que investigaciones recientes detectan serios problemas en la aplicacin de la pena de muerte en el estado de Florida, entre ellos la existencia de disparidades geogrficas y raciales, y tambin el hecho de que no se requiera unanimidad por parte del jurado para ste tipo de casos.
 
  Por ltimo pedirle, Sr. Gobernador, que teniendo la posibilidad de detener la ejecucin del ciudadano y PERSONA: Angel Nieves Daz, haga todo lo posible para que as sea.
 
  Un saludo y gracias.

 Dear Governor/Sr. Gobernador:

   Este mensaje es para mostrar mi absoluto rechazo a
la condena a la pena capital a la que ha sido
condenado el preso Angel Nieves Diaz y que, si usted
no lo impide, se hara efectiva el proximo 13 de
diciembre.

   En primer lugar me gustaria mostrar mi apoyo y mis
condolencias a la familia de Josep Nagy, asesinado en
el bar Velvet Swing Lounge en 1979. Mi oposicion a la
ejecucion de Angel Nieves Diaz no va contra la
necesidad de impartir justicia a la que la familia del
asesinado tiene todo el derecho.

   Angel Nieves Diaz fue condenado por dicho asesinato
por un jurado popular en 1986 en proceso en el que
aparecen varias dudas:

   En primer lugar la votacion del jurado no fue
unanime si no de 8 votos contra 4 a favor de la
ejecucion.

   En segundo lugar hay numerosas seales durante el
proceso que ponen en duda la capacidad del acusado
para ser juzgado y para ejercer la capacidad de
representarse a si mismo en su defensa: falta de
dominio del idioma, problemas mentales resultado de la
adiccion a las drogas del acusado, etc...

    En tercer lugar le pido a usted que valore el
hecho de que, el otro acusado del asesinato, Angel
Toro, fue condenado a cadena perpetua con lo que se
muestra una disparidad de condenas entre ambos
acusados por los mismos delitos.

    Por todo ello, le solicito humildemente que tenga
a bien intervenir para detener esta ejecucion, sobre
la que tantas dudas razonables se plantean y que solo
significaria una triste vengaza por parte del Estado y
un retroceso de la verdadera justicia,

Atentamente,

Fernando Justo

Sr. Gobernador,

Me dirijo a usted manifestando mi apoyo a la familia de Joseph Nagy,

crimen ni del sufrimiento que ha causado.

An as me opongo a la ejecucin de NGEL  NIEVES  DAZ. Todas las seales

Es de sealar la disparidad de las condenas en este caso, en el que un

muerte, pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quien fue el autor de 
los disparos.  Estoy preocupada por el uso contra ngel Daz del testimonio 
de un informados encarcelado, un tipo de testimonio notoriamente poco 
fiable.

Es de sealar que cuatro de los miembros del jurado no votaron a favor de la 
pena de muerte.

Es de sealar que una reciente investigacin ha detectado serios problemas 
en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos la 
existencia de disparidades geogrficas y raciales y el hecho de que no se

My his grandfather was Jimmy (James) Longo and Santo Trafficante's personal body guard and limo driver. My ex-fiance has about 300 immediate family members in Tampa Bay; they practically control the legal system there. They have harassed my 82 year old Granny, and called upon friends of the family to harass me by leaving messages on my mother's answering machine.

Mr. Davis, I am Keith Hodges' son and again, on behalf our family, thank you
for your reply to my father's email. Please feel free not to reply to this
email but because you are the first person to reply to us with any knowledge
and intelligence, I have a few questions that have been troubling me. I'm 28,
Taylor's closest family member and our family has somewhat flourished since
the time of his conviction (as we all know Taylor would have as well). At the
time of his arrest, we were not able to afford private representation and
Taylor was indeed a naive high school kid who was willing to cooperate with
his appointed attorney and authorities as indicated in all of the court
documents and police correspondence. I will be short because I am very
thankful for your time...if a kid was not read his rights when arrested, was
represented by an attorney who was later disbarred and convicted by a judge
who was lobbying for "gang laws" in Florida, who would our family or Taylor
contact so that these facts are addressed? Would the Florida Parole
Commission be the correct avenue? We have given clemency a shot but as you
stated, it is rarely granted. Our family has tremendous loyalty to Florida,
its officials and the Bush family. We are simply confused and a bit
frustrated what is deemed fair and unfair in the eyes of our great State. 

Again, we thank so much for at least listening and responding. I wish you all
the best in your future endeavors and please know our family will always be
supportive of all of you who represent us.

optimism on this matter, but the reality is that Taylor's case is, in fact, 
the exception that warrants Executive intervention.  I personally witnessed 
the Clemency Board granting second chances to individuals who had far 
greater participation in serious crimes than Taylor, but what they had in

Dear Mr. Hodges:

Thank you for your thoughtful e-mail to Governor Bush regarding  your 
nephew, Taylor Wells.  The Governor understands your concerns in this regard 
and asked me to respond on his behalf.

As you know, each state attorney is an elected official charged with certain 
discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether to prosecute 
any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction.  This 
decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt 
shown, and in the best interest of justice.  The Florida Constitution limits 
the Governor's intervention in criminal cases.  Questions about the guilt or 
innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to commit a crime, or the procedural 
fairness of their convictions must be addressed in the courts. Those who 
wish to contest judicial rulings work with an attorney about what appellate 
procedures may be available.

The Governor has no independent ability to pardon someone. The clemency 
function is a power to grant full or conditional pardons, restore a felon's 
civil rights, or commute punishment.  There are complicated rules for these 
lengthy procedures, and these powers are vested in the Governor only with 
the agreement of three Cabinet members who are also statewide elected 
officials. Clemency for prisoners is seldom granted, as it is necessary to 
await the outcome of court appeals.  The Florida Parole Commission, an 
entity independent of the Governor's control, determines the issues of 
control release and early release.  The Commission's address is Building C, 
2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida  32399-2450.

Thank you again for writing and for sharing your concerns with Governor Bush 
about this important issue.

Subject:	Execution of Angel Nieves Diaz

Dear Governor,

     Through amnesty international I heard about the execution of ANGEL
NIEVES DIAZ scheduled for December 13, 2006.
I would like to express my sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy, who was
killed on December 29, 1979. I do not want to downplay the seriousness of
this crime or the suffering caused but I oppose the use of death penalty in
all cases on humanitarian grounds.

     In ANGEL NIEGEL DIAZ` case there is evidence calling into question his
competency to stand trial and represent himself. Further I see the disparity
in sentencing in this case with one defendant receiving a life sentence and
another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman. I am
very concerned at the use of jailhouse informant testimony against ANGEL
NIEGEL DIAZ, a notoriously unreliable form of testimony.

     The jury recommended a death sentence by eight votes to four. Recent
research has found serious problems with Floridas capital justice system,
including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement
for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions.

     I urgently ask you to commute the death sentence of ANGEL NIEGEL DIAZ
on the grounds mentioned above and on the basis that his execution would be
in violation of the right to life as proclaimed in the UN Declaration of
Human Rights.

     I look forward to hearing from you soon in connection with this serious
matter.

Yours respectfully

Sr. Gobernador de Florida

JEB BUSH

The Capitol, 400 South Monroe Street, Tallahassee, FL 32399, EE.UU.

 

Seor Gobernador: 

 

Me dirijo a Ud. para expresarle mi apoyo a la familia de Joseph Nagy, asesinado en 1979, sin pretender restar importancia a la gravedad de este crimen ni el sufrimiento que ha causado. 

 

Me opongo a la ejecucin de Angel Nieves Daz, ya que en los procedimientos posteriores a la condena se han presentado pruebas y testimonios no presentados durante el juicio. Tengo en cuenta la infancia de abusos y problemas mentales de ngel Daz, y sobre su adiccin a las drogas desde los 16 aos. Tambin considero que se ha argumentado que la acusacin no desvel los indicios de que haba sido ngel Toro quien haba disparado a Joseph Nagy, adems en la vista de determinacin de la pena y pese a pedir representarse a s mismo, ngel Daz admiti ante el tribunal que no estaba capacitado para hacerlo adecuadamente. 

 

La disparidad de las condenas en este caso, en el que un acusado recibe una pena de cadena perpetua y el otro una condena de muerte, pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quin fue el autor de los disparos, y la existencia de un testimonio poco fiable hecho por un informante encarcelado, me llevan a expresarle mi preocupacin. 

 

Adems se debe tener presente que cuatro de los miembros del jurado no votaron a favor de la pena de muerte y que una   reciente investigacin ha detectado serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos la existencia de disparidades geogrficas y raciales y el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad en el jurado para imponer la pena. 


Por todo lo expresado solicito a Ud. Seor Gobernador de Florida, intervenir para que ordene la detencin de esta ejecucin.

Subject:	RE: wrongfully accused and jailed

            Thank you for your prompt response,  however, the states 
attorney nor the public defender have any of his information and he has been 
jailed since 11/16/06. I have retained a lawyer in this matter, Eric 
Stevenson, his fees are going to be $17,500 and my husband is not even 
guilty. We have provided the investigators with the information to prove 
that but for some reason they refuse to look at the actual evidence and push 
this based on his picture being chosen off of paper. I myself know plenty of 
people that look alike in pictures. The pictures list NO physical 
description of the perpetrator but the report the woman gave does and it 
does not match my husbands at all.The lasy of the other robbery was not 
asked to look at pictures until a month after the fact. It is not right for 
the county to be allowed to take one away from their families and cause 
suffering and grief when there is question in guilt or innocense. This city 
and county is well known for holding aomeone on bogus charges just so they 
do not have to do the leg work to find the actual criminal. This is wrong, 
the states attorney is only persuing this based on a police report (per our 
attorney who used to work for the D.A.) they will not have the actual 
evidence ie; video tape(s) of the crime, for atleast another month meanwhile 
an innocent man has to lose his job, his housing, and possibly missed the 
most precious moment anyone could experience, the birth of his first born.
             I was under the impression that Gov. Jeb Bush would feel the 
same way about rights, liberty, and justice as the ones that are living in 
this unjust state and that is trying to make things right so police cannot 
just lock anyone up without interegation, questioning, and close 
investigation.    It seems as if these investigators do whatever they can to 
solve a crime fast and without actually investigating. It is so sloppy and 
unorganized it is sickning.
             Do not get me wrong, not all of them are like this....... for 
instance, an investigator by the name of Scott Allday of the ECSO has been 
very helpful, he listens, and does his best to take action, however, his is 
in the narcotic division, not major crimes, so he is limited to what he can 
do. I believe there are still some officers out there that care and enforce 
INNOCENT UNITL PROVEN GUILTY but as we all know it never actually works out 
that way. Being arrested stays with you for your lifetime whether you are 
proven innocent or not. It henders education, employment, etc., he has never 
attempted to do something this major in his life, the biggest and most 
dangerous thing he has ever done was marry me.
              Please, once again, if you are hendered from doing somethings 
then just do one for my family, atleast call and get the investigators 
moving in the right path rather than assuming.

Thank you once again,
Natasha Lovold

Subject:	Oposicin a la pena de muerte ngel Nieves Diaz

Muy estimado Sr. Gobernador de Florida:
Mi nombre es Gloria y vivo en Espaa. Me dirijo respetuosamente a usted para 
expresarle mi oposicin a la ejecucin Angel Nieves Diaz, prevista para el 
prximo dia 13 de Diciembre.
Antes de exponerle las razones que me llevan a oponerme, debo decir que 
quiero manifestar todo mi apoyo a la familia del seor Joseph Nagy, 
asesinado en 1979 y que en ningn momento pretendo restarle gravedad a este 
crimen ni ignorar el sufrimiento que haya podido causar en su entorno.

Quisiera llamarle la atencin acerca de ciertos datos, a mi juicio 
importantes, que he encontrado mientras segua el caso.
En primer lugar,la disparidad de las condenas en este caso, en el que un 
acusado ha recibido una pena de cadena perpetua y el otro una condena de 
muerte, pese a los testimonios contradictorios sobre quin fue el autor de 
los disparos ya que no hubo testigos presenciales del hecho y el uso contra 
ngel Daz del testimonio de un informador encarcelado, un tipo de 
testimonio notoriamente poco fiable.
    Adems existen seales claras que ponen en duda su capacidad para ser 
juzgado y para representarse a s mismo, como son los antecedentes de 
abusos, problemas con las drogas, trastornos mentales y escasa cultura que 
el acusado ha sufrido desde que era un no. A esto hay que unir su escaso 
dominio del ingls.
He observado tambin ciertas irregularidades en la vista que se celebr 
antes del juicio para determinar su capacidad, como el hecho de que ni el 
acusado, ni el abogado de ste, ni uno de los doctores que dictaminaron 
sobre su estado estuvieran presentes en dicha vista. Asi mismo, he sabido 
que evaluaciones psiquitricas posteriores a la condena han revelado 
trastornos mentales en el acusado que impediran que pudiese ser juzgado o 
representarse a si mismo,lo cul fu confirmado tambin por su abogado.
Tambin creo que el hecho de que el acusado tuviese que hacer su alegato con 
grilletes puestos contribuira a que fuera percibido como ms peligroso por 
el jurado, lo cul podra haber tenido un peso decisivo en el veredicto 
final con el que, le recuerdo, hubo cuatro ciudadanos de doce que no 
estuvieron de acuerdo.
Para terminar, estoy segura de que tiene conocimiento de un estudio 
realizado recientemente bajo los auspicios del Proyecto de Aplicacin de la 
Suspensin de la Pena de Muerte, del Colegio Estadounidense de Abogados,que 
identific serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital 
en Florida, entre ellos el elevado ndice de personas excarceladas del 
corredor de la muerte tras demostrarse su inocencia (22 desde 1973 que, de 
haber sido ejecutadas no hubieran podido disfrutar de esta condicin), la 
existencia continuada de disparidades raciales y geogrficas, que no se 
requiera unanimidad en el jurado para imponer la pena y el hecho de que no 
se da peso suficiente a los efectos atenuantes de la discapacidad mental 
grave.

Habindole expuesto lo ms brevemente posible mis argumentos y confiando en 
su sentido de la justicia y la libertad de la que su pas es smbolo, le 
pido sincera y encarecidamente que intervenga para detener esta ejecucin.
Le reitero Seor Gobernador mi peticin as como mis ms humildes respetos.
Se despide de usted:
Gloria Riol Gallego

Excelentsimo Sr governor Jeb Bush:

De mi consideracin:

                           Habindome enterado que pronto ser ejecutado en el Estado de Florida, el acusado Angel Daz; me dirijo a usted para que interfiera y anule esa decisin.

                           Me apoyo en los siguientes motivos: dos fueron los acusados y a uno se le dio cadena perpetua y al otro sin que se haya probado feacientemente que fue l quien dispar se lo sentencia con la pena de muerte , me parece un trato desparejo de justicia.

                           La historia de vida y las facultades mentales de Daz son un atenuante para esa pena capital mxima.

                           Me solidarizo totalmente con la vctima y su familia, pero que pasara si despus de ejecutar a Daz se comprobara su inocencia, no hay vuelta atrs.

                           Por ltimo creo que la vida no puede ser quitada por nadie, ni por un delicuente ni por gente de bin que reunida lo decida, pnganlo en prisin perpetua, pero la vida es sagrada...no se la quiten.

                            Esperando una respuesta favorable, me despido de usted.con todo respeto.

                           Mirta Cidra

Dear Governor,

concerning the case of ngel Nieves Daz, 55 years old prisoner sentenced to death (see end of current text), please bear in mind the following: Ten commandments (The text of Deuteronomy 5:6-21):

   
 
6I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; 7you shall have no other gods before me. 8You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 9You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and fourth generation of those who reject me, 10but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments. 11You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name. 12Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. 13For six days you shall labour and do all your work. 14But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any workyou, or your son or your daughter, or your male or female slave, or your ox or your donkey, or any of your livestock, or the resident alien in your towns, so that your male and female slave may rest as well as you. 15Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day. 16Honour your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you, so that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. 17You shall not murder. 18Neither shall you commit adultery. 19Neither shall you steal. 20Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbour. 21Neither shall you covet your neighbours wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbours house, or field, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.

AU 317/06 Pena de muerte / preocupacin jurdica

EE. UU. (Florida) ngel Nieves Daz, de 55 aos de edad

Est previsto que ngel Nieves Daz sea ejecutado en Florida el 13 de diciembre de 2006. Fue condenado a muerte en 1986 por el asesinato, durante un robo, de Joseph Nagy, encargado de un bar, en Miami en 1979. 
Joseph Nagy era el encargado del bar Velvet Swing Lounge. Muri de un disparo el 29 de diciembre de 1979 cuando tres hombres robaron en el establecimiento. No hubo testigos presenciales de los disparos. ngel Daz y ngel Toro fueron acusados de asesinato en primer grado en 1984, pero el juicio se retras hasta diciembre de 1985. Para entonces, ngel Toro se haba declarado culpable de asesinato en segundo grado a cambio de una pena de cadena perpetua.
ngel Daz, originario de Puerto Rico, estuvo representado por un abogado hasta poco despus de la seleccin del jurado. Justo antes de la apertura de su juicio, y contra el consejo de su abogado, decidi encargarse l mismo de su defensa. El abogado inform al juez de que ngel Daz haba "mostrado tendencias bastante extraas" en los das anteriores, con conductas como no responder a las preguntas del abogado o dar respuestas irracionales. Tambin dijo que, en las 24 horas anteriores, ngel Daz haba rechazado la estrategia de defensa que haban elaborado en los meses anteriores.
El juez interrog al acusado sobre su decisin. Mediante un intrprete (su ingls era limitado), ngel Daz dijo que nunca haba ledo un libro y no tena "ni idea" de cmo se llevaba a cabo un juicio en Florida o "qu cosas puedo alegar". El juez le dijo: "Puesto que no puede hablar ingls ante este tribunal, no conoce la ley, y no [concluy sus estudios escolares], este Tribunal opina que a usted le resultara imposible actuar como abogado en su propia defensa". ngel Daz mantuvo su decisin y el juez resolvi que la haba tomado de manera libre e inteligente.
El juez hizo que dos psiquiatras evaluaran a Daz tras los procedimientos de ese da para determinar si estaba capacitado para ser juzgado. Mientras tanto, el juicio dio comienzo: Daz hizo su alegato de apertura y la fiscala present a cinco testigos antes de que se dictara un receso para el resto del da. Los dos psiquiatras evaluaron a ngel Daz esa tarde. A la maana siguiente se celebr una vista para determinar la capacidad del acusado, sin que estuvieran presentes ni ngel Daz ni el abogado que le ayudaba. Las actas de esa vista se componen de unas pocas frases. Uno de los psiquiatras dijo al juez: "ngel Daz es apto. Pero me dijo que le gustara tener alguna ayuda legal tcnica para su defensa". El juez dijo a continuacin que tena un informe del otro mdico (que no estaba presente) que deca que ngel Daz estaba "muy capacitado". Despus de eso se permiti que el juicio continuara.
Las evaluaciones realizadas tras la condena por dos expertos en salud mental concluyeron que ngel Daz sufre ciertos trastornos mentales que contribuyeron a su decisin de representarse a s mismo y minaron su capacidad para hacerlo de forma competente. El abogado que lo represent hasta la apertura del juicio firm una declaracin jurada en la que deca: "No creo que ngel Daz estuviera capacitado para representarse a s mismo. A consecuencia de ello, hizo preguntas que no debera haber hecho y no pudo protestar a ciertas preguntas y pruebas despus de que yo le aconsej, a travs del intrprete, que lo hiciera. No creo que comprendiera adecuadamente el sistema judicial y la forma de realizarse el juicio, a causa de las diferencias culturales y las barreras lingsticas, entre otras razones".
Durante el juicio, ngel Daz fue obligado a permanecer con grilletes. Durante la seleccin del jurado, su abogado haba protestado contra esta medida, pero el juez respondi que Daz poda cubrirse los grilletes con los pantalones o el abogado poda colocar su maletn delante de las piernas del acusado. Sin embargo, una vez que ngel Daz empez a representarse a s mismo los grilletes quedaron a la vista del jurado, lo que plantea dudas sobre su efecto perjudicial respecto a la presuncin de inocencia. Adems, se ha demostrado que la aparente peligrosidad de un acusado es un factor sumamente agravante a los ojos de los jurados de casos de pena capital que deciden entre condenas de muerte o de cadena perpetua.

La ex novia de ngel Daz testific que, la noche del delito, ste le haba dicho que ngel Toro haba disparado contra un hombre durante el robo. El testimonio de otras dos personas, que estaban en el bar en el momento del robo, indicaba que ngel Daz no haba sido el autor de los disparos. Sin embargo, un informador encarcelado declar que, mientras estaban en la misma celda, ngel Daz haba indicado que haba disparado a Joseph Nagy. El testimonio de este tipo de informadores es notoriamente poco fiable. La Comisin sobre Pena Capital, establecida por el gobernador de Illinois tras dictar una suspensin de las ejecuciones en el ao 2000, examin la cuestin de estos testimonios y, en su informe de abril de 2002, concluy que, incluso con las salvaguardias ms estrictas, "la posibilidad de que se presenten testimonios de fiabilidad dudosa sigue siendo elevada, y no es aconsejable imponer una condena de muerte en tales casos".
El jurado se retir a deliberar sobre la cuestin de la culpabilidad. Durante sus deliberaciones, pidieron copias del testimonio de la ex novia y el informador encarcelado, pero el juez se neg a proporcionrselas, y dio instrucciones de que el jurado se basara en su recuerdo de lo que los testigos haban dicho. El jurado emiti un veredicto de culpabilidad.
La vista de determinacin de la pena se celebr dos semanas despus. Al inicio, pese a pedir representarse a s mismo, ngel Daz admiti ante el tribunal que no estaba capacitado para hacerlo adecuadamente. El tribunal entonces nombr como representante durante esa fase del proceso al abogado que ayudaba al acusado. ngel Daz se neg a permitir que el abogado interrogara a los primeros testigos de la acusacin. El abogado aleg como atenuante que Daz slo haba sido cmplice del delito, pero no present ningn nuevo testimonio a este respecto. El jurado recomend una condena de muerte por ocho votos contra cuatro.
En los procedimientos posteriores a la condena se han presentado pruebas y testimonios, no presentados durante el juicio, sobre la infancia de abusos y problemas mentales de ngel Daz, y sobre su adiccin a las drogas desde los 16 aos. Tambin se ha argumentado que la acusacin no desvel los indicios de que haba sido ngel Toro quien haba disparado a Joseph Nagy. En un memorndum fechado el 6 de febrero de 1984, el fiscal escribi: "En algn momento, los tres sujetos sacaron armas y anunciaron que se trataba de un robo. Se realizaron disparos. Al parecer, el acusado Toro agarr a Gina Fredericks por el cuello y la llev de vuelta hacia la oficina, donde se encontraba la caja fuerte. Parece ser que la vctima Nagy sali de la oficina en ese momento. El acusado Toro dispar contra Nagy una vez en el pecho, causndole la muerte".
Un estudio realizado recientemente bajo los auspicios del Proyecto de Aplicacin de la Suspensin de la Pena de Muerte, del Colegio Estadounidense de Abogados, identific serios problemas en el sistema de aplicacin de la pena capital en Florida, entre ellos el elevado ndice de personas excarceladas del "corredor de la muerte" tras demostrarse su inocencia (22 desde 1973), la existencia continuada de disparidades raciales y geogrficas, el hecho de que no se requiere unanimidad en el jurado para imponer la pena y el hecho de que no se da peso suficiente a los efectos atenuantes de la discapacidad mental grave. 

ACCIONES RECOMENDADAS: Enven sus llamamientos para que lleguen lo antes posible, en ingls o en su propio idioma:

- manifestando su apoyo a la familia de Joseph Nagy, asesinado en 1979, y explicando que no pretenden restar importancia a la gravedad de este crimen ni del sufrimiento que ha causado;

Dear Governor

A convict named Angel Nieves Diaz is set to be executed on the 13th of December. I am writing as a support for him, thought I do not wish in any way to downplay the seriousness of whatever crime he committed or the consequences of his crime. Mainly, this is not about the Angel Diaz, nor me or you; this is about justice. There are clear evidence that Angel Diaz is and has been dealing with mental illness; along with his lack of language skills, make the trial of him unjust. Death penalty in these circumstances (or whatever circumstances there are) is highly unjust.

Please rewoke the sentence

Dear Governor, 
I am an Irish librarian living in Wales, recently I have heard of the case of:

Angel Nieves Diaz

who is scheduled for execution in Florida on 13
December 2006. He was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder
during a robbery of bar manager Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979.
I wish to express sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy, am not seeking to
downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused.
I am opposing the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz as I note evidence
calling into question his competency to stand trial and represent
himself. I also note the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one
defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite
conflicting evidence about who was the gunman, and am concerned a 
th use of jailhouse informant testimony against Angel
Diaz, a notoriously unreliable form of testimony.I also see that four of the jurors did not vote for the death
Penalty and must highlight recent research that has found serious problems with
Florida's capital justice system, including geographic and racial
disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury
sentencing decisions.I therefore call on you Governor to kindly intervene to stop this execution. 
Many thanks for your assistance in this matter,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
    Hi, my name is Miranda Williams, I am a 23 year old student and mother from Wesley Chapel, Fl. I have recently read an article in the Tampa Tribune which really upset me, and I want my voice heard!!!!!  Let me start by telling you the article.  "Driver Given Life Sentence In Death Of Trooper"
"Lake City
    A driver convicted of second degree murder for causing a crash that killed the FHP chasing him recieved the maximum sentence Wednesday of life in prison.  Gregory Hampton Platt had taken a life that cannot be replaced, said Third Judicial Circuit Judge Paul Bryan. "If any sentence would bring him back to life, I would do it," Bryan said.  Platt also was sentenced to 15 years in prison for fleeing a police officer in a high speed pursuit and an additional 15 years in prison for leaving the scene of an accident resulting in a death.  He also recieved 60 days in jail on a charge of driving with a suspended or revoked license, but recieved credit for time already served.  He is already serving 55 years in prison from additional charges in citrus county, where he was captured after the April 2004 wreck that killed Sgt. George "Andy" Brown III."  So that is the article that I am very upset with.  The reason why?  My grandmother Darlene Waltz was killed by a drunk driver on April 7, 1996, on State road 70 in Manatee county.  She was headed home to Okeechobee when a man crossed the center line and hit her head on going approx. 60 miles an hour.  She had no where to go and no time to react.  The 20 something year old man that killed her had been drinking, had not slept in 72 hours, and had been contemplating suicide.  This man lived, he will never be able to walk again but that is a very small price to pay for killing someone.  To make matters worse he was not sentenced to any jail time, let alone life in prison.  Now I am upset with this article because that man recieved life in prison for killing a state trooper.  I'm sorry if this comes out the wrong way but why was that state troopers life more valuable than my grandmothers?  Was it because he was a state trooper? My grandmother was a very hard working, honest, loving, and intelligent woman who deserves the same justice as that state trooper.  I know to many years have passed by for anything to be done about it now but I dont feel that it is right the way this justice system has come to this conclusion.  Imagine if this had happened to your family, wouldn't you want the same kind of justice that the state trooper received?  This man destroyed my family, literally, and my grandmother got no justice!!!  I appreciate your time in reading this letter and I hope I hear a response back from you as this is an important matter to me.
 
Yours Truly,
  Miranda Williams

Dear Governor,
As a member of Amnesty International , I write of my anxiety that  
Angel Nieves Diaz (m), aged 55 is facing the death penalty for a crime 
committed nearly 27 years ago. You will no doubt be aware of the 
numerous inconsistences of his trial, including the disparities in this 
case where one defendent has been sentenced to life imprisonment and 
the other sentenced to death,  and the fact that the jury in the case 
of  Angel Nieves Diaz were not unanimous in their verdict. Would you 
not agree with me that the verdict therefor must be considered unsafe. 
The crime of which he is accused was a terrible one, and one feels the 
greatest sympathy for the family of the victim Joseph Nagy.
  Even so, I do trust  that in the cause of justice you will stop this 
execution.

Yours sincerely

Dear Governor Bush,

 

My name is Michael Bechard.  I am a Roman Catholic priest and a professor at The University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada.  I grew up in Windsor, Ontario which is only minutes from Detroit, Michigan.  I also completed my graduate studies in the United States of America.  I have a great deal of affection for your country.

 

I am also a volunteer with Amnesty International and I write to you concerning the immanent execution of Angel Diaz.  As a fellow Christian, I implore you to stop the execution.  


The research that I have done on the matter indicates that at the time of trial that not all of the jurors voted in favour of the death penalty.  Further to this, it is a basic lack of justice to allow one defendant a life sentence while the other is given the sentence of death.  As I am sure you are likely aware, much of the evidence to convict Mr. Diaz was provided by a jail house informant.  This information coupled with statistical evidence noted elsewhere shows serious defects in Floridas capital justice system.

 

In the end, it has been proven time and time again that capital punishment does not serve as a deterrent to crime.

 

In no way do I want to downplay the seriousness of the crime.  I cannot begin to imagine the pain that Mr. Nagys friends and family must still feel.  Yet, as a Christian and a believer in the One who came to bring peace and justice through offering his life as a ransom for many we who are Christians cannot ever willingly and knowingly take the life of another.  God alone is the giver and taker of life.

 

Please do all that you can do to commute his sentence and to work towards an abolition of capital punishment in your great country.

 

Know that I will keep you and this intention in my prayers.

 

I look forward with anticipation to your response.

 

Sincerely,

I am writing to you to express my deep sympathy for the family of Joseph Nagy.

I also want to note that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty.

Dear Governor,

I am writing to opose the execution of Angel Nieves Diaz.

I would first like to convey my sympathy for the the family of Joseph Nagy, 
who was killed in 1979 and I am in no way trying to downplay the seriousness 
of the crime of murder or the suffering it causes.

However, I do oppose the death sentence in this case for the following 
reasons. Post conviction assessments by two mental health experts concluded 
that Angel Nieves Diaz suffers from certain mental health disorders which 
contributed to his decision to represent himself and undermined his ability 
to do so competently.

As well,  there is disparity in this case with one defendent receiving a 
life sentence and Angel Nieves Diaz the other defendent receiving the death 
penalty, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman.  I would 
also like to note that I have concerns about the jailhouse informant who 
testified against Angel Nieves Diaz.  Jailhouse informants are notoriously 
unreliable and should not be the only form of evidence needed to convict 
someone of the death penalty.

I would also like you to take into consideration the fact that four jurors 
voted against the death penalty.  They obviously felt that there was lack of 
evidence in this case to sentence a man to the death penalty.

I am sincerely asking that you reconsider this case and intervene to prevent 
the execution of a man who may be innocent.

Thank you

Dear Governor, 

I write as the wife of a US citizen and as a frequent visitor to Florida
during my childhood (we visited Florida in October every year). I have fond
memories of your wonderful state, although I haven't had an opportunity to
visit recently.

My sympathy goes out to the family of Joseph Nagy; they have suffered a
great deal as a result of the heinous crime that was his murder in 1979. I
do not seek to downplay the seriousness of the crime, but I must oppose the
execution of Angel Nieves Diaz. The reasons for my opposition are as
follows:

1. it is questionable whether he was competent to stand trial and in
particular to represent himself, and there is evidence from his original
lawyer and others to this effect;
2. in spite of uncertainty over who was the gunman, one defendant has
received a life jail term and the other a death sentence--a great disparity
in sentencing;
3. the case relied in part upon notoriously unreliable jailhouse informant
testimony against Angel Diaz;
4. the vote for the death penatly was not unanimous--four of the jurors did
not vote for the death penalty.

Finally, as you are doubtless aware, the American Bar Association identified
serious problems with Florida's capital justice system, including geographic
and racial disparities, the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury
sentencing decisions, and failure to give sufficient weight to mental
disability. 

I beg you, Governor, to intervene to stop this execution.

  Dear Governor,  


I am writing to ask you to intervene in the case of Angel Diaz who is scheduled for execution in Florida on 13 December 2006.   He was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder during a robbery of bar manager Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979.


This is not simply a death penalty issue where I might, as an Amnesty International member, argue against execution under any circumstances.  This case, as I read it, touches on issues of basic justice and the integrity of the American legal system.


Mr. Bush, if you or your officials study the court records of the trial and conviction of Mr. Diaz, I am sure you will see that:
a)  he "defended" himself even though, because of his lack of familiarity with court procedure and poor English skills, he was incompetent to do so;
b)  he appears to have been suffering at the time from mental illness;  and
c)  there is evidence to indicate that he was not the shooter when, during a robbery, the victim was killed.


Are these not grounds for clemency?  Do you, does America, care about basic justice -- about the right of an accused to adequate legal representation?  Will you not intervene in this situation to ensure that the justice system of Florida is seen to be fair and just?


I look forward to your answers to some of these fundamental questions.


Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am a professor of philosophy at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Canada.  I have a strong interest in human rights issues in Canada and around the world and an active member of Amnesty International which, as you no doubt know, is a non-partisan human rights agency.  

 

I am writing to express concern about the case of Angel Nieves Diaz who is scheduled for execution on December 13, 2006 having been convicted in 1986 of murdering Joseph Nagy in Miami in 1979.  Having suffered through the death of a nephew, I have the utmost empathy for Mr Nagys family and friends.  Theirs is the sort of suffering that does not end and they are, of course, entitled to see justice done.  However, the information I have received makes me very worried that justice has not been served in the case of Mr Diaz.

 

In the first place, there is a substantial body of evidence to suggest he was not competent to stand trial and should not have been allowed to represent himself including the testimony of the lawyer charged to defend him and mental health assessments conducted after his trial. This evidence seems to have been disregarded to date. 

 

Second, the other accused person in this case, Mr. Angel Toro, pled guilty to the crime in exchange for a life sentence.  It is hard to justify a more severe sentence for Mr Diaz when there are no eye-witnesses to the shooting of Mr Nagy and conflicting evidence as to who fired the fatal shot.   (Two people in the bar testified that it was Mr. Toro, not Mr Diaz, who shot Joseph Nagy.)

 

Third, the evidence against Mr Diaz included testimony by inmates.  Study after study has shown such testimony to be unreliable.

 

Fourth, the American Bar Association has noted significant racial disparities in sentences in Florida courts.  (Mr Diaz is Puerto Rican and was forced to wear shackles throughout the trial, despite research findings suggesting this is prejudicial.)  The same report cites the failure in Florida courts to give due consideration to mental disabilities as mitigating factors in crime.  (Mr. Diaz is a victim of child abuse and has a record of mental problems.)  

 

Finally, notwithstanding all of the above, four jurors were against the sentence of death in this case.  I might add, as you know, the American Bar Association has also expressed concern that unanimity among jurors is not required in death penalty cases in Florida.

 

I have a different view of the death penalty than you do but this is not the issue I am raising here.  The issue here is whether the trial and sentencing of Mr Diaz meets the standards of justice the United States holds itself to and of which it is rightly proud.  It seems to me there is ample evidence this is not the case.  In light of this, I implore you to intervene and stop the execution of Mr Diaz on December 13th, 2006.

 

I would appreciate any further information you may have about this case.  Thank you for considering my concerns.

Thank you for answering my letter.  I don't feel that you looked into this 
at all however.  He has tried to appeal and the appeal got lost.  Even 
though the officer who arrested him stated in his trial that he complied 
with everything that was asked of him, the judge ignored him.  This is very 
obviously a case of discrimination.  An innocent young, black man is in jail 
for doing nothing wrong and I feel that just like everyone else,  you could 
care less.  He bought a boat trailer and got a receipt.  He complied with 
everything that the officers asked of him but was arrested for resisting 
arrest without violence.  He served 3 years in prison and then all but 6 
days of 3 years probation, paid all fines and fees ahead of schedule, has 
done nothing against the law in all that time but regardless of the facts of 
the case, Judge OConnor sentenced him to 5 years for "willfully, violating 
probation"  This is America, not Russia, and we are entitled to freedom from 
this kind of treatment.  If this was a member of the Governor's family or 
even my own family, being white, this would not have happened.  This young 
family is in jeopardy of losing their home and no one seems to be able to 
help.  He has a public defender for his appeal, but the appeal has somehow 
been lost, and another  lawyer for the resisting arrest as it is in another 
county.  It is a catch 22 as he would not be serving any time if he could 
appear in court in Martin County but he is in Miami. He requested a speedy 
trial, but had been unable to appear in court because he is in prison in 
another county.  Every time it comes up on the docket, he gets a bench 
warrant because he can't be there.  The judge in Broward would have to 
release him and drop the sentence if he could just appear in Martin County 
and get the charges here dropped.  Then there would be no violation of 
probation, which there never should have been any way.  It was 1:00 AM and 
they had to take him in on something until they could get it all figured 
out.  The officer told Mario that he would speak with his probation officer 
but neglected to do so.  By the time he spoke up in court, it was too late, 
as the judge was not interested in listening to reason.  As I am a white 
woman, I don't know that much about the NAACP but I have also written them 
asking for help.  This is one of those occasions that if we could just get 
someone in authority to look at this case, they would see how ridiculous it 
is before this family loses their home.  Mario has a new daughter that he 
hasn't even seen yet.  All he did was buy a boat trailer and try to show the 
officers a reciept.  There were 6 patrol cars and many officers at his house 
in the middle of the night.  His civil rights have been violated and no one 
cares.  I am so naive that I thought that because I voted for all the Bushes 
and believed in them that maybe one of them would be able to help Mario. 
This experience has been a real eye opener.  If you have any other ideas 
that may help, please write again.  I wrote Mark Foley before his problems 
began and was pleased that someone from his office called me back.  She told 
me that nothing could be done at that time as he hadn't been sentenced yet. 
At that time, we believed that justice would prevail.  What a joke.  There 
are real criminals out there all over the place but my tax dollars are 
keeping an innocent young man in prison.

Dear Mr. Bush,
I am writing to you about an injustice that involves a close family friend. 
We are so confused as to what to do now.  His name is Granville "Mario" 
Williams.  When he was 17, in June 2000, Mario made a bad decision under the 
influence of a family member to traffic in cocaine.  He was sentenced to 3 
years and then 3 years probation.  He served the 3 years in a juvenile 
facility and also did all but 6 days of his probation.  He paid all his 
fines and cost of supervision early.  Since he was released 3 years ago, he 
has attended IRCC, started several businesses, bought a house, and is a 
wonderful father to his 2 sons.  He is a bright, hard working young man and 
has totally turned his life around.  In June 2006, he bought a boat on Ebay 
and then bought a trailer to go pick it up with.  He paid for the trailer 
and got a receipt.  Upon his return from picking up the boat,  several 
Martin County Sheriffs deputies came to his house in the middle of the night 
and accused him of stealing the trailer.  He went into his van, which was 
still attached to the trailer with deputies in the boat and surrounding his 
vehicle to get the receipt.  He turned the key on to turn on the interior 
light.  A deputy tapped his flashlight on the window and told him to get out 
of the vehicle.  Mario complied with everything that was asked of him.  He 
was arrested for resisting arrest without violence.  The next day, he bonded 
out, paid to get the trailer out of impound and located the true owner of 
the trailer.  He returned it to him and offered to buy tires for the trailer 
because of the trip to NY.  The owner refused and told Mario that he knew 
that he was not involved at all.  Mario then proceeded to buy another 
trailer for his boat.  On July 1st, Mario, his pregnant fiance, his 2 sons, 
and my son were out on our boat.  Mario went a bit too fast in a no wake 
area and was pulled over by Marine patrol.  When they checked his licence, 
to everyone's surprise, there was a warrant for his arrest for violation of 
probation.  He was taken to the Martin County jail and then sent to Broward 
county.  Even though the officer testified at his trial that Mario complied 
with everything that was asked of him that night, Judge O'Connor sentenced 
him to 5 years for "willfully violating his probation".   This young man is 
an honest, hardworking member of society who tries to do everything right in 
an effort to make up for the mistake of his youth.  He only had 6 days left 
of his probation and bought a boat trailer from a boat yard here in Martin 
county.  He had no idea that it was a stolen trailer or would never have 
bought it.  We fail to understand why he has been sentenced to longer than 
his original sentence.  I truly believe that if he were not a young black 
man living in East Stuart, none of this would have happened.  He has been in 
jail for 5 months for doing nothing wrong!!!  He missed the birth of his 
daughter and his businesses have no one to run them with him gone.  At the 
present time, he is trying to appeal the sentence.  If the charges in Martin 
county are dropped then there was no violatioin of probation and the 
sentence would have to be overturned.  Now with the holidays right around 
the corner, the wheels of justice are turning slower and slower.  I have no 
doubt that if this had happened to my son, a white young man, in our 
neighborhood in Stuart, it would never have gone anywhere.  I understand 
that they wanted to bring him in until they got it all figured out as it was 
in the middle of the night, but to then keep him in prison for 5 months 
while all the ducks get put back in a row is a grave injustice.  Is there 
anyway to get this man home to his family and back to work before the 
holidays?  This is America and things like this are not supposed to happen. 
This is like some nightmare that you read about in a magazine not something 
that happens to our friends and family.  It is such a catch 22.  Mario 
requested a speedy trial but everytime it gets on the docket in Martin 
county, he is unable to be there as he is at the South Florida Reception 
Center.  His discharge date right now is 7/19/2008.  For What??? For turning 
on the key in his van to turn on the lights to find the sales receipt? 
Where was he going to flee? With deputies surrounding his vehicle and 
standing in the boat?  With his young sons and pregnant fiance in the house? 
This is so crazy.  Where is the justice for Mario?  No one that hears of 
this case can believe that he is still in prison but the end is way in the 
future.  Judge O'Connor is such an imposing woman that he had a difficult 
time finding a lawyer who would represent him in her court.  Any help that 
you can offer would be greatly appreciated. My son and I are working with 
his father to try to get his released but we keep running into brick walls. 
I just don't understand why someone doesn't see how unfair this is and just 
let him come home.  This is like every bad joke ever heard about southern 
justice.

Dear Governor Bush:

As a frequent Fl visitor, and someone who plans to retire to your state.  I 
must tell you I have deep concerns about my future home.

It seems that an unusual number of really bad things have happened to 
children in Fl.  I don't think their is anything you can do about that, but 
O. J. Simpson is another matter.

Somehow O. J. Simpson felt FL was a good alternative to CA, and it wasn't 
just location.  O. J. came to FL to keep from paying a huge debt to the Ron 
Goldman family.
Fl law allows O. J. Simpson to continue to victimize this family.

I am a supporter of both you and your brother.  I just believe you have a 
chance to be a hero before you leave office.  You could at the very least 
have O. J. move out of the South, and even better, see that the family of 
Ron Goldman recovers the money they are owed by O. J. Simpson.

Thank you for your time,

Subject:	Help on trying to clarify some adoption laws.

Dear Governor Bush,

                                   My name is Patricia Rowe and I have
an inter family adoption situation and I'm not sure who
to turn to for help.  On November 22, 1996, my neice Michelle Lynn
Hoffman gave birth to a little girl named Elin.  my neice and Elin's
father were not married.  On December 27, 1998 my neice passed away.  My
sister, who is my neice's mother and her husband, my neices step-father
adopted Elin to keep her in the family.  Soon after the adoption my
sister and her husband serparated.  My sister, Elin, and my sister's
yougest son, came to live with my boys and I.  They lived with me from
November of 2000 till April of 2002.  In April of 2002 they moved out. 
On June 13th, 2002 my sister took her life and Elin and my youngest
nephew came back to live with me.  Elin lived with me untill June of
2004, when her adopted father asked to have her for the summer.  He was
64 years old, found out he cancer, and wanted to spend the summer with
Elin.  He had just gotten remarried. His wife was 65 almost 66 at the
time.  He assured me that he would bring Elin back to me at the end of
the summer.  My family, (my mom,Elin's biological great-grandmother, my
nephew, Elin's biological uncle and myself her biological great-aunt)
went to a family attorney to find out if we had any rights to her.  We
were told that as long as he was alive, we had no rights to her because
he was her legal father, but that if he passed away we could have her
back because we are blood family.  I asked the attorney if he could have
his new wife adopt Elin and the attorney said no not with out the
families' permission.  Elin's adopted father passed away the day after
Thanksgiving 2005 and my family hired an attorney to try to get Elin
back, we found out that he had his wife adopt her.  So we hired another
attorney and tried to get the adoption over turned.  During that process
we found out that Elin's adoptive father lied on his petition to have
his new wife adopt Elin.  He claimed to be the b iological grand-father
and made no mention of Elin having any other biological family.  Eveen
on the paper work thst he had to fill out on where Elin had lived of the
five years,from 2000-2005)  who she lived with, and whatr relation they
were to her, he failed to mention that we were biological.  The judge
that handled the adoption, retired in Feb. of 2006, we tried to get be
fore him to have him over turn the adoption but he retired befor we
could get a court date.  The new judge would not over turn the adoption,
and no attorney will take the appeals because there is no trans-script
of the hearing.  Attornies havee speculated that the judge ruled the way
he did based on misinformation but with out a trans-scripted no one can
be sure.  So we arewith out Elin and can not see.  He adopted mother
will not allow us to even though we were the only family she knew for
the first seven years of her life.  

Whjat I would like your help with is who do I get in touch with or how
dio I go about getting inter family adoption laws changed or clarrifed? 
This should not be aloud to happen to any other child or family.  I'm
not trying to change regular adoption laws,just inter family.  In a case
like this her blood family should have standing, because we are her
blood.  Yet I was told I didn't have standing because I wasn't her
mother or father.  My sister adopted EWlin to keep her with her blood
family.  I don't think this is right or fair to Elin or my family.  If
you can assist me with any informationor stear me in the fight direction
I would greatly appreciate it.  This law need to be clarified.  I hope I
made myself clear.

Thank you for your time in reading this lette, and thank you for the
years you have spent as our Governor.

Sincerly, Patricia L. Rowe

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, 

 

I was assigned a project in my Health Law Class that would address a legal issue along with five questions to ask a local or state official. I chose you as the state official and I would appreciate if you would immediately address the five questions listed below for completion of this assignment.  Below are some facts that I have researched to provide you with an overall understanding of my assignment. Thank you in advance for your immediate response.

 

1.	According to the U.S. Surgeon General, one in five Americans suffer from a mental illness.

 

2.	Since 1983, over 60 people with mental illness or retardation have been executed in the United States; 283,000 in 1998 were incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons. 

 

3.	It is estimated that 10% of death row inmates suffer from serious mental illness.

 

4.	Only a third of mental health illnesses are treated in Americans in the United States.

 

5.	Many of these offenders are poor, uneducated and lack insurance coverage and are Due to the budget cut in mental health services, they limit accessibility to the necessary drugs for treatment of those illnesses.

 

Questions

1.	What is the best argument for the death penalty and is it without error? 

 

2.	Does evidence imply that the death penalty deters murder more than any form of punishment by law? 

 

3.	How much discretion should be given to states to determine whether an individual is "mentally retarded", and therefore protected against infliction of death penalty under Atkins v Virginia?
4.	Due to the reduction/lack of mental health care services, do you believe that this has consequently provoked unnecessary murders and suicides that could have been prevented?

 

5.	Are the conditions of correctional facilities deplorable? If so, have those conditions inhibit poor health among inmates in the institutions of Florida?

Hello Governor Bush,

Thank you for being a good governor that we have had, you change a lot of values to family

and that is greatly appreciated.  I just have a question about the alimony laws in Florida, nothing

to do with child support just alimony. Where do I start about seeing changes in Florida Alimony 

Laws, I have a real problem with this, especially for someone who has paid out alimony for ten years

and changes has develop, why does one have to pay alimony for so long.  Especially when that person 

could have worked and take care of herself.  I am a woman and I am against these laws that Florida

Alimony has.  There really needs to be some changes in the laws for this, for one to pay alimony for a

short time not for a life time.  Any help would be so greatly appreciated, again thank you for your 

time.

Thanks for your time, but I think you did not read the letter properly
because the problem is not about getting a lawyer; I have one, the
problem is Tallahassee that does not want to give the credit. And if we
take it to an appellate court it will take just the time that he got
left. That is why I thought this department might be able to help us,
but I guess I was wrong.

Thanks again for your time.

Dear Ms. Nunez:

Thank you for writing Governor Bush.  The Governor understands the pain
a prisoner's family and friends endure and asked me to respond on his
behalf.  
 
Questions about the guilt or innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to
commit a crime, or the procedural fairness of their convictions must be
addressed in the courts. Those who wish to contest judicial rulings
should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be
available. If you need assistance in locating an attorney, contact the
Florida Bar's Attorney Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.
 
Decisions over prisoners' movement within the system, rehabilitative or
educational programs, temporary release permission, and incentive gain
time are under the authority of the Department of Corrections.  For
further assistance, please write to Department of Corrections, 2601
Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2500.

To further assist you in this regard, I am forwarding a copy of your
e-mail to the Florida Department of Corrections for their review.  I am
confident someone from that agency will contact you at their earliest
convenience.
 
Thank you again for writing.
 
 
Sincerely,

Dear:
Mr.. Jeb Bush





  The reason that I'm writing this letter to you is because I know that
you are a fear person and definitely you have authority over this .I'm
going to explain the matter so you could understand it. My husband is
currently incarcerated, last year the state attorney need it him to be a
state witness in a case after he was already serving his sentence.He
cooperated with them and had no choice,he could not refuse no to be
taking to the Jail County in Miami, FL  they kept him for an amount of
time that cause him to lose about 160 days of gain time because they
forgot after the case was closed that they need it to sent him back, I
tried my best to contact that department and they did not listen to
me,so we had no choice  to hire a lawyer in order to have him sent back
to the correctional. The Judge and the State Attorney admit it that it
was wrong for keeping him there for a long period of time, so they gave
him additional Jail time for those days lost.the motion was sent to
Tallahassee but they do not want to reconsider the error even after
several letters send from this departments. So im asking you to please
look in to this matter and please be fear , my daughter and I need him
here with us where he belongs, and all this time he has been good and
got him self into no trouble while been incarcerated for about 3 years
doing his best to get all his gain time to be with us.Please let me know
as soon as you can, your help will always be remembered. 
May God Bless you and your family.

Dear Ms. Mullen:

Thank you for your letter regarding a Florida criminal case.  Governor Bush is sorry to learn of your concerns. 

Each state attorney is an elected official charged with certain discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether or not to prosecute any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction.  This decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt shown, and in the best interest of justice.  Questions about the guilt or innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to commit a crime, or the procedural fairness of their convictions must be addressed in the courts. Those who wish to contest judicial rulings should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available. 

Decisions over prisoners' movement within the system, rehabilitative or educational programs, temporary release permission, and incentive gain time are under the authority of the Department of Corrections.  The Florida Parole Commission, an entity independent of the Governor's control, determines the issues of control release and early release. 

The clemency function is a power to grant full or conditional pardons, restore a felon's civil rights, or commute punishment.  There are complicated rules for these lengthy procedures, and these powers are vested in the Governor only with the agreement of three Cabinet members who are also statewide elected officials. Clemency for prisoners is seldom granted, as it is necessary to await the outcome of court appeals.  For more information, you can write the Office of Executive Clemency at Building C, Room 229, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida  32399-2450.

Dear Governor:

I am a mother of an eleven year old boy. A boy who is warm and caring. He is blessed to have love from two committed parents & we are blessed to have him. As you know, pre-teen and teen years can be so disarming - sometimes children make bad decisions. It's our job to make sure he makes good choices. A couple of years ago - when he was nine - he and another boy were playing 'sword fighting' with palm fronds from a tree. My son hit & damaged a growing tree in a neighbors backyard. The neighbor yelled at my boy, banned him from her yard, instructed him never to play with her children again. She never mentioned this to me or my husband. My boy kept this to himself for 2 months, the entire summer. One day we were riding in the car & he asked 'If someone did something very bad & kept it secret, would you forgive him for not telling the truth?'. He started telling me the story of the Star Wars battle of the palm fronds. 

I learned that day - that I hadn't taught him to confide in me immediately. That sometimes bad decisions are made (in this case  - the palm frond battle) - but you should count to ten, catch your breath & go get mom or dad. We can't fix everything - but as adults, we have had to make a lot more decisions than a boy and we can get through whatever it is together. He would have received punishment,  we could have replaced the baby tree. He didn't have to be chastised by the neighbor family for the entire summer. 

We have spent many hours since that day talking about decision making and consequences. I have talked with my boy about Josh Phillips. Josh was just a boy, who initially just made a bad decision. When he first hurt Maddie with the ball - he should have told a parent. He needed to slow down, and get help. Instead he made a child's decision. A child's decision that ended her life and ended his childhood  forever. 

We, as a society have failed Josh. We decided that he was an adult, we punished him as an adult. We sent him to live the rest of his life as an adult with adult prisoners.

Josh was 14, not an adult. Josh did not make an adult decision. An adult would not have hidden her under his bed. 

Now it is time for us to act like adults. Act like parents of a society that has made a wrong decision and correct it. Josh needs to be punished - but as a child - not as an adult. You have the power to do this. I implore you to do the right thing - make it easier for us to sleep tonight, knowing that we have not failed another child. I believe in you -  I know that you will make the right decision for all of us. 

Sincerely,

Jean Mullen

Dear Governor Bush:
One day I placed my hand on my ex-wife's stomach and said "Jimmy I Love You!", each time He would respond with a kick. The next day while I was at work his life was terminated.He was in the seventh month which would have meant a Partial Birth Abortion. That would place his mom in danger that she would nt face by a normal delivery by turning  Jimmy in the womb and delivering by breach delivery all but the head, then stabbing a pair of sisser into the back of the skulll to kill him.
 Jimmy could have lived outside of the womb if his head were delivered. My question is where is the Father's rights if he desires to raise his son and where is the babies rights who has no voice to say "I want to live".
 Every day I desire to hold my son, with no way to do it. My family is completely gone, when I was hard at work trying to provide for my family and my desires tread all over.
 I now seek to provide for other babies needs and to inform others of the pain that never completely goes away.
God Bless

Dear Brittney:

Thank you again for writing.  

Although the Governor appreciates the opportunity to review your concerns, this is a local government matter.  As you may know, our government is structured on the notion that local communities can best assess the needs of their residents.  You would do well to continue to work with your locally elected officials including those in local law enforcement to resolve this problem.  The Governor does not have administrative authority over the local law enforcement agency.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
This is a long story, so right now I will not go into it all or the
beginning.  My husband is innocent of the charges that he is convicted for
and we are waiting an appeal.  I thought that not only our country but also
our state believed in childrens rights and that they are to be heard and
that family is a vital importance in one's character!!!!!!!!!!!!  Since this
whole thing began in our lives I have no trust in any of our state offices.
We have become the victims and the conspiracy has been placed on my family
and husband to continue to punish and torment our lives.  Our family has no
voice for anyone to listen.  As one day I tried encouraging our 14 year old
son, that it is similar to having dad away at war.  He in turn said no mom
you can try to compare it but if that was the situation people would be
there for us and government and church people would be there through many
different ways, they forget that people that are incarcerated have families
and they need the connection especially when it is desired from their loved
ones.  Because we also know that there are families that do not want
anything to do with a loved one that is incarcerated!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The
Department of Corrections has conspired against our family because of the
type of charges that my husband is in for.  I really need someone to listen
and to help!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not just listen and do nothing except say "yes,
mam we understand", and then give no help!!!!!!!!!!!

Dear Friend:
 
Thank you for your letter to Governor Bush about someone facing criminal charges.  He understands the pain friends and family experience in these situations and asked me to respond.

 

As you may know, the decision to charge a person for crimes is made by the state attorney, a locally elected official.  Deciding whether or not to charge a person is based on the best interests of justice and on the quantity and quality of the evidence of criminal activity.

 

The Florida Constitution limits the Governors intervention in matters that should be resolved through the court system.  If you believe a person is innocent, or not guilty of all charges, you may wish to obtain the services of an attorney experienced in criminal defense. If you need assistance in locating an attorney, please call the Florida Bars Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.  

 

Those who are facing criminal charges for which prison time is a possibility, may be appointed an attorney by the court.  For further assistance in this regard, please contact the office of your locally elected public defender.  Please be sure the attorney is provided with all of the evidence you believe shows innocence.

 

The Governor trusts justice will be served in this case.

 

                                                                        Sincerely,

Mr. Bush, 
I am writing to you again because I don't know what else to do.  My daughter just had her first birthday, and I can not even get a paternity test, much less child support.

The father: Justin Elmore DOB 8/1/1985 ss# [REDACTED]  did not show up for court for child support on 10/18/06 in Clearwater because he was in  jail (Pinellas and Hillsborough county) for not paying child support for another child.

I am waiting AGAIN for another court date. 
In the mean time, I have learned that the father is planning on moving out of state with his new underaged pregnant girlfriend. Yes,  this will make baby #3.

What can I possibly do? This is so unfair and my daughter does not deserve this!!!!

Thanks, but this "family" pretty much runs the legal system in Tampa. His Uncle is a civil circuit Judge, his cousin is his representing attorney, another cousin works for the D.A. and another is an attorney (these are just those that I'm aware of. In fact, the Uncle to which I refer is Sammy Pendino who was handling the Robert Buonanno case (a judge who had a dancer pole installed in his chambers for his mistress). I can't get representation from legal aid in FL because I am a GA resident. The entire case is out of jurisdiction & moreover is extortion. I have tried to give back the ring & they only want the appraisal value. Such a shame that FL is being run by corruption!

Dear Ms. Medina:

Thank you for your recent e-mail to Governor Bush requesting assistance with a child support matter.  He has asked me to respond.
 
The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that should be resolved through the court system.  The person who can best answer your legal questions is an attorney.  If you need assistance in locating an attorney, please call the Florida Bar's Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.  Those who have limited financial resources should consider contacting their local legal aid office or foundation.
 
As you may know, the Florida Department of Revenue is the state agency that houses the Child Support Enforcement Program.  This agency is responsible for establishing paternity, enforcing child support obligations, and locating non-custodial parents.  Enforcement tools include: wage withholding, contempt of court, interception of unemployment benefits, IRS refunds, and lottery winnings, and liens on personal property and real estate.
 
You may wish to contact this agency at your earliest convenience to inquire what methods are available to enforce the court ordered payment of child support.  Please call your local branch offices for the Department of Revenue.  That number can be found in your local telephone book or by calling directory assistance.  If you need immediate assistance, please contact the state offices for the Department of Revenue at (850) 922-9590.
 
Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.  Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.
 
Sincerely,
 
Warren Davis
Office of Citizens' Services

Dear Mr. Davis:

This appears to be a form-letter response.  The information you  
presented here is information I've had since I intervened in this  
case last June.  I've already spoken with the Office of Executive  
Clemency and have done everything the rules called for.  They advised  
me of the need to invoke rule 17 in order to get the inmate on the  
agenda for clemency.  I would hope you have read my previous letters  
to the governor and you would have a more in-depth understanding of  
what I'm trying to accomplish.

Sincerely,
Lynda Carter Markham

Please thank Governor Jeb Bush on my behalf and also for Nancy for your help to her/us and that your sensitivity and care mean so very much.  It is refreshing to find and to know that there are still government entities that have a heart and passion for people!  Please let Governor Bush know that many of us here in Colorado wishes that he would run for President!  He would definitely get our vote!

Subject: Will you please help?


Hello Governor Bush:

I am actually a resident of Colorado.  My husband and I are Republican and we support your brother, George W. Bush 100%.  My husband and I have raised two beautiful daughters.  Both of them graduated from colleges in Florida.  Our youngest daughter, Holly Mauldin Filer, is now a High School Physical Education teacher in St. Petersburg, Florida.  Recently, I visited my daughter in Florida.  While attending a volleyball tournament, of which  Holly's team was playing in, I met one of the team players mother.

Here is my request.  I am so burdened for this woman, and she is struggling to find help for herself and for her daughter.  I am repeating to you some of the information that this woman shared with me, because of her fear, her frustration and her lack of ability to take on the judicial system of which her husband is a part of.   This woman was married to a man who is a prominent lawyer in the Clearwater, Tampa area.  She was married for thirty some years.  She has been a "stay at home" mother and her husband took care of all financial matters for the family.  

According to this mother, her husband of some thirty years had an affair and is asking her for a divorce.  Now, this matter is directly between them, and I understand that.  However, a real injustice has occurred for this woman in the judicial system in Florida for the following reasons:  According to the information supplied to me by this woman the following has happened to her.

    1.  Her husband and his law firm partner have both divorced their wives and have successfully hidden funds (their monthly earnings) from their former wives.  Leaving them with only the $4,000 dollars a month income ordered by the court.  She has no ability to get to what was once their savings accounts or checking account money.

    2.  This woman's husband has been ordered to pay for her attorney, and has not done so.  She has lost three attorney's to represent her because he will not pay the money for the lawyers up front and so they drop her case.  She also feels that these attorneys drop her case because of intimidation by her lawyer/husband towards these attorneys.

    3.  The last attorney was going to ask the present judge presiding over this case to remove himself from the case because of personal ties to the husband/lawyer.  However, because the attorney had not been paid, (in which the husband was required to pay) she dropped the case and did not file the needed papers in the allotted time to have this judge removed from the case.

   There are many, many more issues at hand for this woman and her family.  She has raised two sons and has their third child, a daughter still in High School.  She is responsible for the financial burden of raising this daughter based on the amount of money that her husband/the lawyer gives to her.  None of the children want anything to do with their father.  He is angry with the wife and the children and is making their lives miserable by withholding funds for their care.  The judge sits back and does not make him follow through with his responsibilities.  She states that at a couple of the hearings he has been allowed to talk to the judge and when she tries the judge cuts her off.

My question and request to you is this:  

    1.    This woman has no money, because her husband has total control of all funds

    2.    This woman cannot get representation because her husband/a lawyer has
           intimidated each lawyer she has hired and then he does not pay them for
           her representation (per the judges instruction)

    3.    This woman cannot get a lawyer to take her case pro bono and none will take
           her case without $10,000 dollars of money up front.  (She can't get money from
           her husband, and he refuses to pay her lawyers.  The judge sits back and does
           nothing.

In your state, who is there to protect the woman (a stay at home mother) that hasn't worked for over thirty years, has no money and has to battle a legal system of which her husband is a part of and his actions of intimidation and "good ole boy" club is preventing her from getting legal and fair representation.

To whom, in your state of Florida, can this woman turn to for for help and for a fair and just hearing in this divorce proceeding?  The legal system in your state is failing her and her husband is using his position as a lawyer, to manipulate the system, the other lawyers involved, and the legal process.   She stated to me that a criminal is afforded legal representation (at no cost) otherwise known as a "public defender", but a stay at home mother, who has not worked, has no money, no representation and no "public defender" available to her.

Will you please contact this woman at: NancyFuller@juno.com with information of where she can go for help, legal advice and financial support to equip her with the legal defense she needs to represent her side of the story and her children.

I normally do not get involved in situations like this, but this woman has lived in a lifestyle where her husband was bringing in 20,000 dollars a month.  He now gives her $4,000 dollars a month and expects her to still care for her high school daughter, make the house payment on the existing home that they have lived in for years, and this money is suppose to cover all up-keep and utilities expenses. 

This case needs to be looked into to make sure that the judicial process is not corrupt and that a woman who is having to depend upon the judicial system in which her husband, as a lawyer, is a part of, is not being unethical.

Will you PLEASE help this woman by placing her in touch with the proper individuals that can help her and investigate this situation.

I respectfully place my request for your help in this matter.  This is a matter of integrity and a case where the judicial system needs to be monitored to make sure that each citizen is given a fair and equal voice in an unfortunate divorce case.

Thank you in advance for your help to this woman, Nancy Fuller and I trust that your office will conduct a proper and legal investigation into this matter.

that it is a lenghty process, I am sorry that I started so late in the 
request, becuase I know the Governor Bush would not let my son waste his

harm.  I will still be in touch with who ever can help my son, and I may be 
back in touch.  THANK YOU again for the number and information on the 
clemency  board, and I HAVE hired some excellant lawyers, it's just that my 
first lawyer was extremely wrong in reporesenting us.   Thank you again, 
please let Governor Bush read of this situation, maybe after his term in 
office is over he still may be able to help direct our family in a positive 
direction.  I feel it is one step forward and two steps back.

Currently there is a no contact order stating that we are to have no contact with the children. We found out about the no contact order on August 26, 2006 and since that time have tried to find out the reason for it to no avail. Calls made to those involved with this case at DCF are not returned. 

In legal cases defendants are advised as to what the courts feel they are guilty of and are presumed innocent until found guilty. Defendants are given the opportunity to prove that they are not guilty of charges brought against them. Why are we not being given the same rights? 
We have not been given the reason behind this no contact order and because the charges against us have never been told to us. Because we have never been advised of what we supposedly have done wrong we can only assume that it is due to our making waves in the system by reporting the Baker/Clay Kidsnet caseworker to her supervisor and Magistrate Grant to Judge Crenshaw. Rather then have to go by assumptions we would like to know what the factual reasons for the no contact order are.

Subject:	My state and my county have failed my family

I am sorry to say the Alex Hager from Tom Gallegers office has forgotten my family. That Harry Shorstien at the states attorneys office is useless unless your a judge or a lawyer or apparently richer, smarter or more powerful then our dumb family. I'm no genious, I'm a mom and a wife of twenty five years. My public servants have failed me and my family. Why make it illegal to run up liens in one companies name, transfer all it's assets into a brand new companies name without the liens on paper, sell the same hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets that don't disclose those liens to a third company, take the money and pay the federal government becuase they have assessed a 117000 tax lien on this person from his last wheelings and dealings. Where is the ball and under what shell? I am a mom. My husband cooks and cleans and manages food. My daughter and sons bus tables and take order and design menus. No we are not big busineess people andmabie not smart enough to know! how to be a lawyer but we had over 70 employees and 40 small business vendors and all of us were paying alot of taxes. Our family was growing a nice a sucessful restaurant that we bought, land, building and all. A piece of paper was typed up like I am typing this email. This person signed the paper. I wish I could make it more complicated but the truth is our property was transfered with paper, out of our name with no notice or disclosures, no filings, no liens, no mortgages, no late fees...don't you find that odd? Don't you think if there was a real reason that we would know it? Do't you think with the thousands of bank regulations that someone would have called us and said, ok, dumb people the law says this and this is what happened to you and these are your options...right? No. The political races are on and the parties are going on everynight with the fund raising and no one is running the store. Many really big crimes have been commited. Many big deseptive practices and regul! ations have been broken. I need my state and my county to move us from the three years bottom of the pile to the top and get those crooks out of our life!
The special procecutors office in Jacksonville tells me if a lawyer knows how to splice out when a criminal act has taken place and when a civil act has taken place then have them call us. nother words no you dumb citizen! If a lawyer calls them and says yes it's criminal to transfer real estate with liens on it to another companies name without paying the liens (DUH) or disclosing or paying THE OWNERS (DUH). Then if a lawyer said to them yes it is illegal for this convicted felon and tax evader to borrow 75000 against said equipment then ON PAPER to tranfers 200,000 in said equipment, cash register, computer and other equipment with the 75k liens on it into  a second newly formed companies name and then sells it to a third party for cash with ever disclosing those lien or paying those liens even I'm smart enough to know thats stealing!!! Now the lien holders are comming to get all the resteraunts equipment right while it's making folks lunch! What i! s this guy saying? Not much. His name is Howard Shane Shafer.
Call the last two victems, my family was number one we think...904-874-4504 is victem number Basil Chandler two-Shafer took the tranferred and refinanced real property amd assets/equipment and so it looked like it was free and clear, not complicated, just crooked, Shafer got all his and his brothers money and now the lien hlders are coming to get the equipment, our equipment that Shafer stole from us after refinancing it and transferring it into his name and selling it free and clear, then Al Ridreguis- ex-bank examiner has put down 10,000 to buy said same equipment AGAIN but got lucky and connected the dots but has yet to get his deposit back.
An us...the ones who the equipment belongs to and we own and we never ever gave it away or sold it. Will you please show this to somone not as dumb as me and let them explain what stealing is to the arresting office. I don't expect to hear back from anyone becuase my family is invisable. I don't expect any more divisions or offices of this or that. I'm surrendering to burocracy and the missing people who talk on the phone and meet and help families in crisses, victems of white collar crime and corruption and Harry Shorstiens and the police departments break down and apathy.

Subject:	Criminal probe needed

Once again I write as I strongly feel a criminal investigation need to be undertaken, of the States Atty's office here in Collier County. My question is this; If evidence is ignored and obstruction takes place during a criminal investigation, who can right this wrong? To ignore this request is in and of itself, terribly wrong. It's never to late to do the right thing; and the right thing here is an open investigation, into obstruction of justice, malfeasence of office, and open disregard of exculpitory evidence. Not to mention false and/or misleading official investigation reports. Now what can be said to this? Except an investigation will be conducted.

Dear Warren,
Thank you for writing back.
Please mention to the governor that while it may appear that while "Governor Bush shares the concerns of many that the death penalty must be reserved for only the most heinous cases." it should be noted that it never is efficacious. There is no evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime and there is strong evidence that it may have the opposite effect. While I appreciate the Governor's concern for victims, it is also true that execution is basically a form of vengeance on the part of the state and it rarely brings closure to the suffering of victims.
Respectfully,

Pastor Russ Eanes

Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush about a death row inmate.  The Governor appreciates your  concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.
 
Governor Bush believes that the death penalty is appropriate and warranted in certain capital murder cases, and supports its use by the courts in those cases.  The Governor also believes we should look not only to the issues surrounding the defendant, but also to the surviving victims, and to the effect the murder has on our community as a whole, in deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment.
 
Florida law provides numerous levels of appeals for the convicted individual before the sentence is moved.  Once a person is convicted of an aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida, the state voluntarily provides free legal representation to the convicted murderer until the sentence is carried out or reduced on appeal.  No other state has invested the public resources in capital post conviction legal representation that Florida has been providing for well over a decade.
 
Governor Bush shares the concerns of many that the death penalty must be reserved for only the most heinous cases.  As the Governor has said many times, the signing of a death warrant is one of the most solemn and somber responsibilities he must undertake, and he does so with humble deliberation.
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to write about this very serious issue.
 
Sincerely,
 
Warren Davis

I thank you for your response, however do not live in the States any more. 
We did have a Lawyer who therefore dropped the case.  My mistreatment at 
this hospital was so horrific that I will now go and meet with my local 
member of Parliament and also Amnesty International.

I have also offered to go and see Pat Hall in Tallahassee first as she is 
dealing with my case and indeed it was her words that I was "chemically 
incarcerate".  I have spoken to Ms Hall on occasions and found that she is 
genuinely a kind and compassionate lady.

Thanks once again for your prompt response.

Dear Mr. Blom:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush.  The Governor is sorry to learn of 
your concerns, and has asked me to respond.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that 
should be resolved through the court system.  I understand you obtained 
legal counsel to assist you in this regard.  That was the appropriate thing 
to do and I encourage you to continue working with your legal counsel to 
resolve this situation to your satisfaction.  If you are dissatisfied with 
your attorney need assistance in locating another attorney, please call the 
Florida Bar's Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.  For those unable to 
afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services or your local legal aid office has 
information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone 
number for Florida Legal Services is 850-385-7900.

For further assistance, you may wish to contact the Florida Department of 
Health whose Division of Medical Quality Insurance regulates health care 
practitioners including doctors and nurses.  The Florida Department of 
Health also reviews and responds to complaints against health care 
practitioners and determines whether complaints warrant investigation.  I 
encourage you to contact this state agency in writing at 4052 Bald Cypress 
Way, Bin #A00, Tallahassee, Florida, 32399-1701 or by calling (850) 
245-4321.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems 
you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.

Sincerely,



Warren Davis

Dear Mr Bush

My husband and I were on L1 and L2 Visas respectively whilst residing in
Florida.

We are now living back in the UK having set up our internet bulb company in
the USA.  We have been in business since 1860  and supply many members of
the British Aristocracy, not to mention supplying historic houses etc. in
the UK.

Whilst being treated at Celebration Hospital over three and a half years ago
my wife was subjected to extreme cruelty.  I contacted Pat Hall and also
engaged the well respected firm of Bogin, Munns and Munns to deal with this
matter.

Too date this matter has not been resolved, although we now live in the UK,
as Bogin, Munns and Munns decided to drop the case.

My wife, Naomi Blom suffers from panic attacks and was on the drug Xanax, at
the time she took 10 X 2mg of these tablets, she was extremely anxious, as
her best friend in Malaysia had just died and on the same day discovered
from her mother in the UK that her father had cancer.  She panicked, after
taking these tablets and I immediately took her to ER at Celebration
Hospital ( at this conjesture, I must add that she had afull unopened bottle
of 100 X 2mg of this drug, so, obviously her intention was not to kill
herself).  We have three boys whom we both love dearly.

I am sending you these photographs of her hand, where an orderly grabbed her
whilst I was out of the hospital trying to reach the British Embassy,  the
incident with the ordrly left her hand disfigured, not to mention the severe
PTSD she still suffers.  I thought that you should be aware of this incident
as it happened in your State.  Pat Hall has always been and continues to be
most supportive of both myself and my wife.

Whilst writing, I must congratulate you on the high standards of education
in Osceola County, our children flourished whilst they were there, in
particular my eldest son Chris, who took part in band and had the
opportunity to play at Disneyworld.  He is now studying A Levels here and
hopes to be able to attend medical School in New York.
The hospitality we received from your fellow citizens was fantastic and we
were very sorry to have to leave when business brought us back to the UK.

By nature, we are Conservative and therefore Republicans.
Your brother, The President is doing a fantastic job, it's a pity that more
world leaders do not have his strength and absolute resolve.

I am sorry that I have had to contact you with regard to this, however would
not like this sort of incident to occur to anyone else.

Yours most sincerely

Paul Blom

Governor Bush received your e-mail and asked me to respond on his behalf.

 

Unfortunately, the Governor's Office has no jurisdiction over matters in the criminal justice system.  You may need the services of an attorney.  

If you need assistance in locating a lawyer, please call the Florida Bar's Attorney Referral Service toll-free at 1-800-342-8011.  

 

Those who cannot afford attorney's fees, but are facing criminal charges for which prison time is a possibility, are appointed an attorney, free of charge, by the court.

I would agree with your answer; save to say it's been over two years since it occured! Justice delayed is justice denied!!! All I ask is to have a question asked; WHAT THE HECK IS TAKING SO LONG? This I believe is criminal in and of itself. The plain truth is; exculpitory evidence is being ignored and, we are going broke because of either incompetence or illegalities. Niether have any place in the justice system. Please have the Atty. Generals Office "again" inquire into this matter post haste. All we ask is for justice and justice alone!

>I Sir, once again write you about a terrible injustice here in Collier County. It is about my former Wife's (Victoria Jenkins Dales) legal situation. All evidence shows she shot her husband in self defense, (a kicked in door being the most obvious). We have checked into his (Micheal Dales, aka Micheal Dallas), and found him to have a very dark back ground. I think it's the fact his father, is a former law enforcement officer, that has swayed investigators opinions. The Abused Women's shelter, a noted doctor on this syndrome, and all who know Victoria agree; Victoria isn't capible of the crimes in which she is charged. I here through various sources, the prosecutor's office is only keeping this case active as, they can't win it and don't want to appear soft on gun crimes!!!!! This is very hard on my family, with the limited financial resources we have are nearly exhausted; Please Sir intervene after reviewing this case. Trust me when I say Collier County claims to be a D.V. zone; and if women have to fear being charged like Victoria has, for defending themselves in their own home; Why not declare an open season on wives and female live-ins?

I cannot understand why so much time has passed and Mark Foley has yet to 
be arrested?!?  It has obviously been proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
that this man, WHILE HE REPRESENTED FLORIDA, was actively pursuing 
underage boys.  Isn't this a felony in Florida??  Being denounced in 
public and losing his office is NOT a clear message to other pedophiles.  
Is he a such special friend of yours that his arrest has somehow been 
overlooked?  Or is this just another scandal under your watch?

Dear Governor Bush,
 
    I had sent you an email yesterday regarding the problem that I was having in getting my son his hearing aid batteries in the Joseph Conte facility and I'd just like you to know that he finally was given one battery last night.  Though I still think the Broward Sheriff's Office protocol should be amended so that one does not have to wait almost 2 weeks for such a neccessity.

Dear Lt. Governor Toni Jennings:    I know a woman in your state whose 
husband abandonded her, the house, and the truck. For two to three years she 
made payments on both, saving the house from foreclosure, and the truck from 
repossession. She did this, although neither the truck, nor the house were 
in her name. The asset values were figured against her, so that she was 
forced from her house. Neither her attorney nor others conacted will submit 
an appeal or an injunction. She turns to you for help.    Sincerely, Arthur 
O'Neill                                                                      
    Her contact number:  1 352 464- 0194     HEIDI ARNOLD        addenda: 
1.Four times her husband was ordered by the court to deliver to her a quit 
claim deed for the property; four times he refused the court order.   2. 
Property Tax Department called; asked why her husband had not paid taxes on 
two newly acquired properties. These were not figured in asset values.   3. 
Three times when her attorney was told that she would be 1,400 miles away 
for the week, emergency hearings were scheduled. She was not notified by 
telephone.   4.When she told the judge that her now former husband had 
instructed the mortgage company to refuse mortgage payments from her, the 
judge derisively stated, "What, is your money dirty?"  THANK YOU.

RE: suggestion for the Foley situation

We need to point out the differences in how we handled the Foley situation and how the Dems handled similar situations. Why cant we do that on the stump and with TV ads? It is not that hard.Gary Condit and Chandra Levy(intern), Congressman Studds and his page, and Pres Clinton and his intern. The perpetrator in each situation did not resign and neither did the Dem Leadership.. Why aren't we doing this? There is no scandal here. We are always so defensive when we do not need to be. We are playing right into the Dems hands and the media by being so meek and apologetic.. It would only be a scandal if it was more than one Congressman doing this type thing. There was not so there is no scandal

Subject:	[*] RE: [*] Please help us regarding a family who has been displaced due to unfair laws - RE:  Mary Nemeth

If Governor Bush read the letter, he will see that she does have an
attorney.  The problem we are facing is he is unable to get a court date
until February 6, 2007. 

It is unfortunate that she has had to leave her home that she is buying,
without any help from her ex-boyfriend.  But the ex-boyfriend gets to live
in the home and accrue the bills that she has to pay for.

They have a son together and she has a 17 year old daughter.  The three of
them are now residing in my home since August 5, 2006.  

How can the laws allow him to remain in her home and her and her children
homeless?  Why is it up to me and my family to have to take care of them
when this isn't our problem?  Why can't the court system do an emergency
hearing to get her back in her home prior to February 6, 2007?

Even her attorney doesn't understand why he can't get a hearing sooner than
that.

I understand Governor Bush is busy, but this is a law that is in place in
Florida that needs to be looked at.  There should be times that the court
system can make special circumstances to arrange an emergency hearing
instead of making people go homeless for six (6) months before getting a
court date.  

I hope that Governor Bush would take a few minutes out of his busy schedule
just to see if he can have any input in helping her get her date moved up.

Thank you again for taking the time to look into this matter,

Sherri Stanley-Hufford

October 11, 2006
 
 
To All Florida Congressmen/Congresswomen
 
RE:  Mary Nemeth
 
Dear Congressmen and Congresswomen:
 
My name is Sherri Stanley-Hufford.  I am writing this letter to all of you
in hopes you may be able to help my sister-in-law, Mary Nemeth.
 
Mary has been purchasing a home in Merritt Island for over six (6) years
now.  She was residing there with her boy friend Sean Finnegan, her daughter
Tiffany Nemeth, and her son Sean Finnegan Jr.
 
During the past two (2) years, Mary has been sleeping on her couch while her
boy friend took over her bedroom.  Their relationship has not been a boy
friend/girl friend relationship for over two (2) years.  Mary has asked Sean
Sr. to move out of the house many times, but he would not leave.
 
Sean Sr. has not been helping Mary financially for many, many years.  Mary
has been the sole provider for the entire family.
 
At the end of July, Mary went to the court house in Viera to get an
Injunction to be served on Sean Sr.  It was served and they went to court on
August 4th, 2006.  Sean Sr. denied that there was ever any abuse.  Mary was
not able to get the DCF records to prove otherwise prior to the court date.
The judge dismissed the Injunction.  The judge informed Mary to file for an
Eviction to get Sean Sr. removed from her home.
 
Sean Sr. returned to Mary's home on August 4th, 2006.  On August 5th, Mary
and the children left their home and came to live at mine.  The reason for
leaving was the attitude that Sean Sr. was displaying the Mary and the
children.  Sean Sr. was verbal abusive towards all of them.  Sean Sr.
informed Mary and the children he would drag the custody and get possession
of the home for however long it takes for him to win.
 
On August 7th, 2006, Sean Sr. was served with a three (3) day Eviction
Notice.  
 
On August 10th, 2006, Mary hired attorney, Billy Thomas, located in
Melbourne.  Before filing the necessary documents, Mary's attorney, Billy
Thomas contacted Sean Sr's. attorney, Kenneth Rhoden, located in Cocoa to
see if Sean Sr. would leave the house and let Mary and the children return
home.  Mr. Rhoden stated that Sean Sr. would remain in the home.
 
 
 
Before Mr. Thomas could process the necessary documents to evict Sean Sr.,
Mary was served with court documents for Custody and Division of Property.  
 
Within a week or two, Mary started receiving notices in the mail to help her
home be saved from foreclosures.  Mary is not in foreclosure.  She has been
making ALL of the mortgage payments.
 
Mary went to the Merritt Island office of her attorney and was informed that
Sean Sr. and his attorney had filed a "Notice of Lis Pendens".  Since this
was filed, an eviction process is not an option.
 
Sean Finnegan Sr. is not on the mortgage paperwork, nor is he on the deed on
Mary's home.  Sean Sr. has not been helping make any of the payments toward
the mortgage nor any of the utilities, insurance and/or food for the family.
 
Due to the paperwork that was filed from Sean Sr.'s attorney, Mr. Rhodes,
Mary and her children had to leave their home.  They left their home on or
around August 5th, 2006, and have been residing with my family since that
time.
 
We own a four (4) bedroom home that is in the middle of construction.  We
have my husband (Mary's brother), my son, my step-daughter, my father and me
living here prior to Mary and her children moving in.
 
There are now eight (8) people residing in my home.  We have had to make
arrangements for Mary and her children to have a place to sleep and reside
for over two and a half months (2 ).
 
Mary was advised by her attorney to return home this past Saturday, October
7th.  When Mary arrived back home, she did install locks on all the bedroom
doors to prevent Sean Sr. from taking over the bedrooms.  Sean Sr. has in
the past walked in on her seventeen (17) year old daughter while getting
dressed.  
 
Since Mary was only allowed to take her personal belongings (clothes) and
the children's clothes, everything had to be left in the house.  When Mary
returned to house, she found all of her paperwork (copies of bills, previous
divorce papers, copies of checks, warranties, etc.) was missing.  Her
computer was gone as well as some furniture.  This is just a few of the
reasons for the locks on the doors.
 
On Saturday evening, Sean Sr. starting smoking in the house.  Their son,
Sean Jr., is asthmatic.  Mary asked Sean Sr. to stop smoking but he would
not.  He was mad because Mary returned back to the house.  Mary then,
contacted DCF in hopes they could help her to make Sean Sr. stop smoking in
the home.
 
When DCF came to the house on Sunday morning, they were upset that there
were locks on the bedroom doors.  They were also were upset that Mary didn't
leave again on Saturday night when Sean Sr. wouldn't stop smoking.  Mary did
have Sean Jr. sleep in the bedroom with a towel on the floor covering the
opening left by the door to help prevent the smoke from entering the room,
but he still had to use his inhaler both Saturday night and Sunday morning.
Sean Sr. was still smoking in the home when DCF showed up.

 
DCF gave Mary and Sean Sr. three (3) choices.  One, Sean Sr. could leave;
Two, Mary could stay there but would have to remove all the locks off the
doors and Sean Sr. would have to quit smoking in the house; Three, Mary and
the children would have to leave again.
 
Well, the decision was made for Mary and the children to again leave their
home and come back to my home to reside until the court hearing to help her
get temporary relief to move back into her home without Sean Sr. living
there.  The court hearing is not scheduled until February 6th, 2007.
 
Since Mary has been living in my home, she has had to continue paying the
mortgage for her home, even though she hasn't been living in it; had to
continue paying for all the utilities, even though she hasn't been the one
using the utilities.  But for over two months, Mary has had to pay for these
bills, NOT Sean Sr., even though he is the one that is accruing the bills.  
 
My home resides in Port St. John.  Mary's home resides in Merritt Island.
Her children go to school in Merritt Island.  Mary has to get the children
up earlier than normal to be driven to school in the morning.  She then
returns back to my house in Port St. John, unless she has doctor's
appointments to go to, then she has to return back to Merritt Island by
2:30pm to pick up her son from grade school, then sit around until about
3:30pm to pick up her daughter from high school.  Then she returns back to
my house.  She is averaging about 130 miles a day driving.  Gas alone has
cost her so much just to make sure her children make it to school and home
again.  She is on Social Security and is just able to make her normal bills
not additional expenses like paying for additional gas (especially at the
prices gas is at now), to get her children to school and back.
 
When she was living in her own home, she hardly ever used the air
conditioner to keep her home cool.  She did this to save money.  She would
use fans and keep her windows open to try to keep the house cool.  Her
average electricity bill would be around $50 a month.  The first electricity
bill she received with only Sean Sr. living by himself was $198 for one
month, then $226 for the next month.  She had to pay this as well as the
other utilities.  
 
Since she tried to go home this past Saturday and had to return back to my
home on Sunday, she has now cancelled all the utilities that were in her
name.  Now, when or if she gets to return back to her home, she will have to
reinstate all the utilities and have to pay a higher deposit to have them
turned back on.
 
Mary had to leave all her food at the house for Sean Sr. to eat.  She was
not allowed to take any of it with her.  She has lived with me for over two
and a half (2 ) months.  She has been able to give me $200 to help offset
the additional expenses my family has incurred with her family living here.
My electricity has gone from $289 +/- a month to up to $416 a month.  My
water bill has gone from $19 +/- a month to over $50.  This is not to
mention my grocery bill.  That is almost doubled.  I have spent over $1400
since August just to make sure there is enough food in my home for all of
the meals to feed everyone.
 
We need some help and we need it fast.  How can the State of Florida allow a
home owner with two (2) children to leave their home to allow someone else
to reside in it?  How can the State of Florida allow the homeowner to have
to pay all the bills for the home if they are not residing in it?  How can
the State of Florida allow this person to live for free and make the
homeowner homeless?  How can the State of Florida make it my family's
responsibility to support this family?
 
We are so cramped up in my home.  We have air mattresses everywhere to make
room so they have beds to sleep on.  My home is under construction as I am
writing this to you.  We don't mind helping our family, but it has been over
two (2) months and now we are being told it could be until February 6th,
2007, before Mary could be able to return to her own home.  Since the
situation that occurred on Sunday, October 8th, Mary's attorney is trying to
move the "Relief Hearing" up.  But what does that mean, we have to wait
possibly until January 2007 instead of February 6th, 2007.
 
 
WE CANNOT ALL LIVE HERE FOR ANOTHER FOUR (4) MONTHS, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE
HOLIDAY SEASON.  WE CANNOT HAVE EIGHT (8) PEOPLE STAYING IN THIS HOME FOR
THIS LENGTH OF TIME.
 
WE NEED YOUR HELP.  IS THERE ANYWAY YOU CAN HELP US?  
 
Is there any law out there that can change what is going on with Mary and
her family?  Is there a law out there that can allow her to go back to her
own home, one that she is buying and paying for and make Sean Sr. leave?
 
I have been told that Florida is NOT a "common law" state.  If this is TRUE,
then why is Mary being treated as if there is a "common law"?
 
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, TRY TO HELP US!!!  WE ARE AT THE END OF OUR ROPES;
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.   
 
I AM WRITING THIS TO YOU, HOPING THAT ONE OF OUR CONGRESSMEN/WOMEN WILL BE
ABLE TO HELP US FIND THE ANSWERS WE NEED AND FIND IT FAST, SO WE CAN ALL GO
BACK TO OUR NORMAL LIVES, LIVING IN OUR OWN HOMES THAT WE HAVE WORKED SO
HARD AT BUYING.

As a grandmother of a teenager I am _more_  than disappointed.  It is my 
understanding that the FBI is _only_  investigating whether any Federal 
laws have been violated and not whether any laws of the State of Florida 
have been violated.  To further complicate matters the age of consent in 
Washington, D.C. is 16 (which needs to be changed) and in the State of 
Florida the age of consent is 18.  I would like to see something in the 
newspaper about what actions are being taken by the FDLE from our 
governor.  Coordinating with the FBI tells the voters of Florida nothing.

 Can you direct me to someone that may help with that aspect?  I do not

Mr. Bush, 
 
I am contacting you out of desperation. My grandfather, Walter E.
Smith,  passed away on April 15, 2006, after an accident in a local
Sam's Club.  My uncle, Terry L. Smith, assumed primary responsibility of
my grandmother after his death.  He apparently was added to the bank
account in order to assist my grandmother, Eloise G. Smith, age 88, with
paying her bills, prior to my grandfather's death.  I am sure my
grandfather trusted his judgements at that time, not knowing that the
worst would happen.   On September 20, 2006, my sister, Shawna L. Fikar,
received a call from my grandmother, she claimed her son had taken
$38,000.00 from her checking account (which he was on) and that she was
also receiving notices of NSF's on checks written from her account.
NOTE:  He took the check book, he was signing all checks, he also had
her mail forwarded to a P.O. Box in his name in order to prevent her
from receiving mail on two occasions.  Once realized, she had it changed
back and started receiving items showing other signs of possible fraud. 
A caretaker, Jonette Armagost, Callahan, Florida is a witness to most of
what has been happening.  In responding, we found that he indeed had
removed the money, he also had cashed in Certificates of Deposits, Money
Market Accounts, Savings Accounts, etc.  He was then writing checks to
himself (for caring for her), paying his home mortgage in another state,
his rent in Florida, paying credit card bills...the list goes on.  We
hired an attorney to attempt to retrieve the money.  We have also
contacted Department of Children and Family in Nassau County, where my
grandmother lives.   Case Worker, Lynne Brown has referred the case to
the State Attorney's Office and the Nassau County Sheriff's Office.  We
have also found that he is using one, and possibly more, credits cards
that were issued to either my deceased grandfather, or in both of their
names.  My grandmother did not take care of the finances, so she didn't
even know they had credit cards.  One card is from Sears.  Sears states
that my grandfather was the only card holder on the account.  In
September, Terry Smith ordered a microphone, assuming the identity of my
grandfather and had it delivered to my grandfather's address.  Keep in
mind...this is identity theft.  
 
On October 2, 2006, Circuit Court Judge in Nassau County, Florida,
ordered Temporary Guardianship to my sister, Shawna Fikar, 14643 Corral
Berry Drive, Tampa, Florida  33626, (813) 546-0818.  We have secured
approximately $500.00 that was left in her account, set up all of her
bills to be paid electronically, and an "accounting" will be kept on all
future expenditures from her account.  Our attorney has been very
helpful in quickly addressing our issues, but we feel there are many
loop holes that will allow him to get away with what he has done.  We
need the support and help from someone that has the power to take care
of this man for exploiting and misusing his mother's money for his own
use and pleasure.
 
Another issue is that he has taken her car and will not return it.  It
is titled to my grandmother and grandfather, she pays the insurance, but
the Nassau County S.O. states the laws are funny on that subject and
there is nothing they can do.  Shawna Fikar, current Temporary Guardian,
has sent a certified mail request asking that the car be returned.  No
response from Terry Smith.  It belongs to my grandmother, she isn't
going to drive it, but it is hers and should be at her home if she
wishes.  Where are the laws to protect her?
 
More frustration comes in where we find there are not many laws that
actually hold him responsible.  We keep getting the phrase, "he is
listed on the checking accounts, not much can be done".  Well, he
blatantly used her money for his own affairs.  He refuses to respond to
our Attorney contacts, and is still refusing to return her car.      We
need help.
 
Please help us so that he does not get away with what he has done.  We
would like for her money to be returned and he pay for the criminal acts
he has committed.
 
If you, or someone that has the power to help could contact us, we
would be so grateful.  As in most cases like this, time is not on our
side.  The faster this is addressed, the better chance we have to secure
her missing funds, automobile, and ensure she is taken care of properly.

 
Thank you in advance for any assistance you can give us.

Mr. Davis,

Is it possible you can forward the attached correspondence directly to the 
governors office?  I am VERY frustrated with the response from the director 
of the Drivers License office.  You were very helpful in answering the first 
portion of my question and I appreciate that.  I am in the process of 
meeting with the district attorney for our county.  As to my second issue- I 
am getting no where and am frankly very un-satistified with the response. 
My question and concerns were not answered.  I am not looking for a 
political correct answer, I am looking for the truth.

Any assistance from you would be greatly appreciated!
Michele Ripley


I understand that your department looks into investigations of fraud when a 
case is presented to you.  What I don't understand is how you conduct an 
investigation when you have never spoken with me?  You obviously have the 
ability to pull my drivers license, so you obviously saw that it is signed 
MICHELE RIPLEY.  Did that not raise a red flag with your office that I was 
NOT committing fraud?



Last I checked, in the United States we are afforded the right to face our 
accuser.  Yet your department will tell me nothing of how this investigation 
was conducted, what steps you took to determine I was committing fraud, and 
how your office came to the conclusion, I.e.: documents you received showing 
that I was committing fraud.



Obviously, it does not matter that I tried repeatedly to correct this 
situation.  YOUR office in Miami would NOT accept the documents, even thou I 
repeatedly tried to explain to this that it was an official court document. 
I even went so far as to ask them to call the court house in Cutler Ridge, 
with them telling me "they can call us".  Easier said than done, I can 
assure you.



I did ask my attorney at the time, and he instructed me that when I renewed 
my license, to simply sign with my name- MICHELE RIPLEY.  Which obviously I 
did.



I did NOT receive your notice in 2004.  Not my fault and not yours.  I would 
have taken care of this situation in 2004 if I had received it, I assure 
you.  I did receive the notice this week, after speaking with your fraud 
department.  It states that I am not entitled to issuance until I show legal 
proof of name.  I assure you, this will be taken care of in the next week.



My concern is that now my license shows it has been cancelled and I don't 
want that on my record.  I was NOT committing fraud and frankly, I feel your 
office failed in their investigation.



It is silly for me to hire an attorney, when this can be solved by you 
reviewing the actual documents you received, and re-reviewing your 
investigation to find out why it was not noticed that I signed my legal name 
on my driver's license of MICHELE RIPLEY.



Please do not send me another e-mail which does not answer my question, I 
don't appreciate that and I don't appreciate the fact that you are ignoring 
the obvious.  I did NOT commit fraud.  That is a very serious crime, and I 
do not want to be labeled as one who committed fraud.  I am a law abiding 
citizen and wish to remain one in good standing.



Thank you

Michele Ripley

    Subject: Serious concerns and questions





    Dear Governor Bush,



    I am sorry for contacting your office, but I really did not know where 
to turn.  I felt your office would have the answers I need.  I have made 
over 30 phone calls trying to get an answer to my questions but frankly, 
everyone I speak with gives me a different answer.



    I have two issues that are of great concern to me.



    My first issue.  My husband and I recently testified against an 
individual who had assaulted a member of our family.  She was only 14 at the 
time of the incident, and the individual in question was sentenced to jail 
as a sexual offender. I requested after the hearing (in writing) for the 
case to be sealed, because frankly, this should not follow this young female 
around the rest of her life.  I have been told by the state attorneys office 
in Okeechobee, Florida that this can not be done due to the public having 
the right to access court records.



    It has always been my impression that if the case involves a minor, and 
is of a sexual nature, with a conviction, that the family can request the 
court records to be sealed.  If this is not the case, it should be!  Could 
your legal office provide the law on this to me, so that I can either 
present it to the state attorney in Okeechobee county, or advise me on what 
steps to take to try and pass a law such as this?



    My second issue: I just found out that my license has been cancelled. 
Apparently in 2004 your fraud division of licensing received a report that I 
was committing fraud by using a wrong name on my license.  This is far from 
the truth.  When I contacted the fraud division, they informed me that I 
could not have access to any investigation they performed. How do you do an 
investigation of fraud without speaking to the individual you are 
investigating?  How do you cancel and individual's driver's license without 
informing them?



    My drivers license has the name of: Michele Allen Corbin-Allen being my 
maiden name, and Corbin being the name of my first marriage.  The SIGNATURE 
I sign on my drivers license is Michele Ripley.  I have been re-married for 
16 years.  I have tried over 10 times to have my drivers license changed to 
my married name in Homestead, Florida when we lived there and where I was 
married.  I went to the Cutler Ridge court house, obtained a certified copy 
of my marriage license and took it over to the drivers license office in 
Homestead only to be told that they would not accept it due to the paper it 
was printed on.  (fax paper).  I again went back to the Cutler Ridge Court 
House and explained the situation- they printed out another certified copy 
of my marriage certificate, but it was still on fax paper as this is the 
paper they used in there printers.  Again, the drivers license office denied 
the document.  At this point, when I went back to the Court House, I asked 
to speak with a supervisor, who informed me that there was nothing the mater 
with the document and that there was no reason for the drivers license to 
continue to refuse it.  This was repeated two more times, with me going back 
and forth between the drivers license officer and the Cutler Ridge Court 
house.

    Nobody was budging, and nobody was willing to call there other.



    What was I to do?



    Many years later, during a custody issue it was brought up that I was 
using my previous married name on my license.  I testified in court the 
above situation and the judge stated that it would be in my best interest to 
get this resolved, having nothing to do with the custody issues at hand.  It 
was a suggestion, one that I again tried to resolve.



    I again went to the cutler ridge court house, this time I went back 
three times, with the drivers license still refusing to accept the paper my 
marriage certificate was printed on by the court house.



    What was I to do?  I simply showed ID the last time that I went to renew 
my drivers license, and signed it Michele Ripley.



    Now, I find out that apparently someone complained that I was using the 
name of Corbin and an investigation was apparently iniated, without ever 
discussing the situation with me.  When I spoke with your fraud division and 
explained the above situation, and they pulled up my drivers license, they 
did indeed see that I signed it Michele Ripley.  All they could tell me was 
that they could not believe I was allowed to sign it that way.



    What is there to believe- my name is Michele Ripley and that's how I 
sign my documents.



    I do not feel it is fair to have my drives license cancelled, nor do I 
feel it is fair to have this on my record.  I also do not understand if an 
investigation was done, why am I not entitled to the reports.  I am not a 
minor, I am an adult, this investigation was done in regards to me.  Can 
anyone just report something and you guys take it at face value?  Without 
even speaking to the individual in question?  This can not be the case.



    I would appreciate ANY assistance your office can provide on these two 
matters.



    Thank you

    Michele Ripley

Dear Ms. Ripley:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush.  The Governor appreciates your 
questions and asked me to respond on his behalf.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in criminal 
court cases.  Each state attorney is an elected official charged with 
certain discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether to 
prosecute any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction. 
This decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt 
shown, and in the best interest of justice.  I understand you directed your 
questions regarding a criminal case to the state attorney's office and you 
are dissatisfied with their response, however, that is the office that has 
legal jurisdiction in this regard.  For further assistance, the person who 
can best answer your legal questions is an attorney.  An attorney is also 
the one you should speak with regarding the cancellation of your license. 
If you need assistance in locating an attorney, please call the Florida 
Bar's Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.  For those unable to afford a 
lawyer, Florida Legal Services or your local legal aid office has 
information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone 
number for Florida Legal Services is 850-385-7900.

To further assist you in this regard, I am forwarding a copy of your e-mail 
to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for their 
review.  Should you wish to contact that agency directly, please use the

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems 
you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.

Warren,
 
I am impressed.  I never thought I would get any type of response.
 
The bottom line, is that in Florida, stealing a six of beer carries the same penalty as kidnapping and sexual slavery of a foreign minor; 10 years.  Compare that with the Federal Banking Laws were you can steal $1. 3 Billion and walk away with no prison time and having to pay back only a fraction of what you stole.
 
I know one thing,  I will always buy my beer in Florida.  Of course, if I need money to buy it, I may want to steal the money from the Federal Government, as you will always come out ahead.
 
Thanks for the response Mr. Davis, I think we need courts in this country that serve the people of this country equally and not discriminate based upon class, or other bias of the parties involved.
 
Killers spend less time behind bars then people who could be reformed at less cost to the tax payer.  Governors have the ability to affect change if they get involved.

Dear Mr. Johnson:

Thank you for your letter regarding a Florida criminal case. Governor Bush is sorry to learn of your concerns.

Each state attorney is an elected official charged with certain discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether or not to prosecute any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction. This decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt shown, and in the best interest of justice. Questions about the guilt or innocence of prisoners, mental capacity to commit a crime, or the procedural fairness of their convictions must be addressed in the courts. Those who wish to contest judicial rulings should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available. 

Decisions over prisoners' movement within the system, rehabilitative or educational programs, temporary release permission, and incentive gain time are under the authority of the Department of Corrections. The Florida Parole Commission, an entity independent of the Governor's control, determines the issues of control release and early release. 

The clemency function is a power to grant full or conditional pardons, restore a felon's civil rights, or commute punishment. There are complicated rules for these lengthy procedures, and these powers are vested in the Governor only with the agreement of three Cabinet members who are also statewide elected officials. Clemency for prisoners is seldom granted, as it is necessary to await the outcome of court appeals. For more information, you can write the Office of Executive Clemency at Building C, Room 229, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2450.

Subject: The Adam Bollenbach Clemency


Jeb,
I heard an story about Adam Bollenbach from a segment on the "Geraldo at Large" television segment. I believe his sentence is too harsh for his crime and I belive you should consider his clemency if he has had good behavior while in prison. Please see attached article summary from the "Geraldo at Large" :
"Adam Bollenbach has been in prison for five years, serving time for crime that could have been solved by an apology, repayment, and supervision to assure that he obtained treatment for his mental health problems. 
But why is this Florida teen, who suffers from ADHD and diagnosed as bipolar, serving a ten-year sentence for stealing beer and chips when he was 16? 

Circuit Judge Ric Howard admitted that he was using Adam as a teaching tool in front of other juvenile offenders, which resulted in the teen's ten-year prison sentence. 

Months earlier, Adam had been charged as an adult for theft of a bag of potato chips from his high school lunchroom. The charge was dropped, but according to the law, once charged as an adult, you cannot be charged as a juvenile." http://www.geraldoatlarge.com/blog.php?where_param=blog_id&blog_id=635

Man gets 10 years in prison for harboring sex slave
By Nicholas P. Alajakis
Wednesday, August 2, 2006
Saying she thought his actions were despicable and horrible, a judge on Tuesday sentenced a North Fort Myers man to the maximum of 10 years in prison for harboring a sex slave from Guatemala.

Fernando Pascual, 22, was given what U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Hernandez Covington called a lenient sentence. As part of a plea agreement, Pascual pleaded guilty in March to forcing a 13-year-old girl to be his sex slave and do work around the house. "These are truly horrible crimes you have committed and they will not be tolerated in the United States," Covington told Pascual after sentencing him. Pascual, his sister, Matilde Pascual Andres, and Andres' husband, Pascual Miguel Sebastian, were charged in May 2005 with harboring a young girl in a Cape Coral home. Prosecutors say the girl, referred to only as "EJJ" in court documents, was bought in Guatemala and brought to Cape Coral, where she was raped, beaten and forced to work. Matilde Pascual Andres was sentenced on Tuesday to 22 months in prison for her role in keeping the girl. Pascual Miguel Sebastian was sentenced to 16 months in May on a similar charge. Fernando Pascual was the one prosecutors were most interested in, said Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Doug Molloy. He claimed to be married to the girl, and court records show that he would not allow her out of the home. His sentence of 10 years was in exchange for the victim not having to testify because she was traumatized by the abuse she took for two years, Covington said. "I could have, and quite frankly would have, given you a harsher sentence. (But the victim) should not have to be raped and suffer the consequences of having to come up here and testify against you," Covington told Pascual. "I do not want to minimize what happened here. Your activities are very, very wrong and illegal."

Following the sentencing, Molloy said he is happy that the whole ordeal is over, especially because it allows the victim to move on after 15 months.
"This is finally a chance to everyone to move forward," Molloy said.

And you consider some very divisive dealings at the highest levels of our government that have gone unpunished: See attached article from the "Austin Chronicle":

O, Brother! Where Art Thou?
Like Hugh Rodham, the Bush Bros. Have Capitalized on Family Ties
BY LOUIS DUBOSE

Unless you've been reading the Houston Chronicle society page, it's unlikely you've seen any current news about Neil Bush. The third Bush sibling has been almost as invisible as his apolitical brother Marvin, a venture capitalist living in northern Virginia, and his sister Dorothy "Doro" Koch, the youngest of the five Bush siblings, who quietly raises funds for charities in a Maryland suburb near Washington. While Jeb was governor of Florida and George W. was twice elected governor of Texas, Neil was either part of the late Maxine Mesinger's "crme de la crme crowd" at a Houston social event, or a stale S&L footnote: "the director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan when it crashed in 1988 at a cost of $1 billion to taxpayers." 
In 1990, Bush paid a $50,000 fine and was banned from banking activities for his role in taking down Silverado, which actually cost taxpayers $1.3 billion. A Resolution Trust Corporation Suit against Bush and other officers of Silverado was settled in 1991 for $26.5 million. And the fine wasn't exactly paid by Neil Bush. A Republican fundraiser set up a fund to help defer costs Neil incurred in his S&L dealings. Friends and relatives contributed -- but not then-President and Barbara Bush, which would have been unseemly. Since then, the Bush political combine has done such a remarkable job keeping Neil in the background that what seemed like a 10-year news blackout didn't end until mid-February, when the Austin Business Journal reported that Bush "quietly is heading a local start-up that's raising at least $10 million in second-round funding." According to the business newsweekly, Bush has already raised $7.1 million from 53 investors underwriting Ignite! Inc., an educational software company. After being banned from banking and all but airbrushed out of the family portrait -- or at least the family news profile -- Neil Bush is back. 
Bush wasn't just an average S&L exec drawing a big salary and recklessly pushing a federally insured institution beyond its lending limits. As a director of a failing thrift in Denver, Bush voted to approve $100 million in what were ultimately bad loans to two of his business partners. And in voting for the loans, he failed to inform fellow board members at Silverado Savings & Loan that the loan applicants were his business partners. Federal banking regulators later followed the trail of defaulted loans to Neil Bush oil ventures, in particular JNB International, an oil and gas exploration company awarded drilling concessions in Argentina -- despite its complete lack of experience in international oil and gas drilling. It probably helped that the Bush family had cultivated close ties with the fabulously corrupt Carlos Menem, former president of Argentina. 
When JNB's rights and obligations were assumed by other investors, Neil tried to persuade another American oil and gas exploration company, Plains Resources, to invest in Argentina. Plains wasn't buying. But it was hiring, and picked up Neil as a consultant for its Argentine market -- because, as Plains executive Carlos Garibaldi told The New York Times' Jeff Gerth in 1992, Neil had "traveled [in Argentina] and played tennis with President Menem." Plains President J. Patrick Collins told Gerth at the time that Neil Bush "bent over backwards not to trade on his name." 
That claim was hard to make in 1993, when Neil, Marvin, James Baker III, John Sununu, and Thomas Kelly (who had served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf War) joined President Bush on a trip to Kuwait. Three months out of office, the elder Bush was traveling on a Kuwait Airlines flight to accept an honorary degree from the country's university and its highest honor from its leader: Emir Sheikh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah. The rest of the Bush entourage was following along to exploit the market in a country that considered the ex-president its savior. Former Secretary of State Baker was doing deals for Enron (the Houston-based energy-related company and contributor to Bush the Elder and later a $525,000 donor to George W. Bush's two gubernatorial races in Texas). Marvin was representing U.S. defense firms selling electronic fences to the Kuwaiti Defense Ministry. And Neil was selling anti-pollution equipment to Kuwaiti oil contractors. 
There is "no conflict of interest. ... We're just capitalizing on whatever good feelings exist," an executive from the company Neil Bush represented later told Seymour Hersh, who laid out the embarrassing story on the pages of The New Yorker in September 1993. Neil, according to Hersh, later returned to Kuwait and set up shop in the International Hotel in Kuwait City, where he tried to secure a management contract with Kuwait's Ministry of Electricity and Water. Neil's deal included foreign and Kuwaiti members of the Enron consortium, and would have had the Kuwaiti government paying a management fee to a Kuwaiti company that was owned in part by a private company set up in the Caribbean or some other tax haven. "The offshore firm would have various owners, in Europe and elsewhere, one of which would be a company in which Neil Bush had an interest," The New Yorker reported. The scheme was ingenious, a financial analyst told Hersh."If you looked at one of the contracts, how in the hell would you know that Bush was in it?" The whole deal was as unsavory and unpardonable as a round of golf with Hillary Clinton sibling Huey Rodham. 
Jeb missed that junket, but the current governor of Florida isn't above taking the family name abroad to make a buck. In 1989, Bush and his wife traveled to Nigeria with a executives of M&W Pump, a Florida-based company that had been selling agricultural pumps to Nigeria. Jeb and Columba Bush were received by Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida and celebrated by tens of thousands of Nigerians who turned out to see the son of the U.S. president. President Babangida expressed his interest in visiting the White House -- a request Jeb promised to pass along to his father -- and by 1992 the Florida pump company had secured $74 million in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. It was by far the largest Ex-Im deal M&W had ever done in Nigeria -- a country Ex-Im loan officers considered a bad risk. "I didn't get paid for the Nigeria business," Bush told The Palm Beach Post in 1994. "I have not made a dime on business with Nigeria." Yet the Post found tax records that revealed Bush and earned at least $300,000 through his association with the owner of the same company for which he had done a pro-bono sales trip to Nigeria. Bush-El, a 50-50 partnership with the owner of M&W, paid Bush at least $300,000 for his participation in a separate venture, marketing agricultural hand pumps. Why would Bush suddenly find himself involved with a company selling agricultural hand pumps around the world? the Post asked. "I know how to sell things," responded Bush. "I know international sales. I know how to get people to put together tenders because I financed a lot of them when I was working at Texas Commerce Bank." 
Here in Austin, it's a safe bet that Neil will raise the additional $10 million in start-up money Ignite! needs to get its software to market. In six years at Interlink Management, a venture capital firm he ran out of his father's Houston office from 1994 to 1999, he raised $60 million for high tech and biotech start-ups. Ignite! is a new company and a new market niche, but there's nothing new in what Neil Bush is about this year: leveraging the family name and other people's money into a business that will turn a profit -- if for no one else, at the very least for him. 
Given that Adam Bollenbach's crime pales in comparison to the transgressions committed by others, in your state and within your circle, I believe you should consider giving him a break. It seems others have been treated more fairly then the way Adam has been treated.

I have checked with Florida Dept of Corrections, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, the City of Marianna and the jail which is run by county commissioners.  As long as the inmates are not sex offenders and are in jail on charges such as bad checks, not paying child support or things that are minor to the officials to make them trustees they can come and work under supervision.  If they are from the Dept of Corrections I don't think they can be there when children are present only county inmates, which is what was working with the Optimist Club in the concession area at the last ball tournament and yes as far as I understand they will be there again at this tournament.  If I can help in any other way please let me know sorry it took so long to get back with you, I have been traveling a lot and have slipped behind n my work, I do apologize.

Mr. Davis,

Thank you very much!  You answered my question regarding the criminal case, 
and now I know who and where to further deal with this issue!   I appreciate 
it very much.

As to my drivers license, I already contacted our local drivers license 
office, and spoke with your fraud department.  All I have to do is take my 
marriage license into the local office and it will be re-instated.

I am sorry to say, that the response from the Drivers License office that 
you forwarded left allot to be desired.

Dear Ms. Ripley:



Governor Bush received your recent email regarding the status of your 
driving privilege and asked us respond.



Our records indicate that your driving privilege was cancelled indefinitely, 
effective March 10, 2004, for not being entitled to the issuance.   To clear 
this cancellation from your driver record you must contact our Fraud 
Investigation Section at 850.617.2405 for assistance.



We trust this information will assist you.



Sincerely,

SANDRA C. LAMBERT, Director

Division of Driver Licenses







Apparently, Mrs. Lambert did not even bother to read my e-mail.  If she had, 
she would have realized I was questioning the fact of how her fraud division 
could have an open case without even speaking with me.  I also question that 
fact that I am not allowed to have access to this investigation material. 
Or, how my license was even cancelled when they have the capability to pull 
my drivers license and see that it is signed MICHELE RIPLEY.



Perhaps, you could look into this for me, since you were so kind as to 
answer the first part of my question, and to take the time to give me 
correct information.



I really appreciate it, and thank you so much!



Michele Ripley

Dear Ms. Ripley:

Thank you for writing to Governor Bush.  The Governor appreciates your 
questions and asked me to respond on his behalf.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in criminal 
court cases.  Each state attorney is an elected official charged with 
certain discretionary duties, including the duty to determine whether to 
prosecute any particular crime committed within his or her jurisdiction. 
This decision is based on the quality and quantity of the evidence of guilt 
shown, and in the best interest of justice.  I understand you directed your 
questions regarding a criminal case to the state attorney's office and you 
are dissatisfied with their response, however, that is the office that has 
legal jurisdiction in this regard.  For further assistance, the person who 
can best answer your legal questions is an attorney.  An attorney is also 
the one you should speak with regarding the cancellation of your license. 
If you need assistance in locating an attorney, please call the Florida 
Bar's Referral Service at 1-800-342-8011.  For those unable to afford a 
lawyer, Florida Legal Services or your local legal aid office has 
information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone 
number for Florida Legal Services is 850-385-7900.

To further assist you in this regard, I am forwarding a copy of your e-mail 
to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for their 
review.  Should you wish to contact that agency directly, please use the 
contact information provided below.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems 
you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.

                                                                        Sincerely,

Subject: Serious concerns and questions


Dear Governor Bush,

I am sorry for contacting your office, but I really did not know where to 
turn.  I felt your office would have
the answers I need.  I have made over 30 phone calls trying to get an answer 
to my questions but frankly, everyone I speak with gives me a different 
answer.

I have two issues that are of great concern to me.

My first issue.  My husband and I recently testified against an individual 
who had assaulted a member of our family.  She was only 14 at the time of 
the incident, and the individual in question was sentenced to jail as a 
sexual offender. I requested after the hearing (in writing) for the case to 
be sealed, because frankly, this should not follow this young female around 
the rest of her life.  I have been told by the state attorneys office in 
Okeechobee, Florida that this can not be done due to the public having the 
right to access court records.

It has always been my impression that if the case involves a minor, and is 
of a sexual nature, with a conviction, that the family can request the court 
records to be sealed.  If this is not the case, it should be!  Could your 
legal office provide the law on this to me, so that I can either present it 
to the state attorney in Okeechobee county, or advise me on what steps to 
take to try and pass a law such as this?

My second issue.  I just found out that my license has been cancelled. 
Apparently in 2004 your fraud division of licensing received a report that I 
was committing fraud by using a wrong name on my license.  This is far from 
the truth.  When I contacted the fraud division, they informed me that I 
could not have access to any investigation they performed.

How do you do an investigation of fraud without speaking to the individual 
you are investigating?  How do you cancel and individual's drivers license 
without informing them?

My drivers license has the name of :Michele Allen Corbin- Allen being my 
maiden name, and Corbin being the name of my first marriage.  The SIGNATURE 
I sign on my drivers license is Michele Ripley.  I have been re-married for 
16 years.  I have tried over 10 times to have my drivers license changed to 
my married name in Homestead, Florida when we lived there and where I was 
married.  I went to the Cutler Ridge court house, obtained a certified copy 
of my marriage license and took it over to the drivers license office in 
Homestead only to be told that they would not accept it due to the paper it 
was printed on.  (fax paper).  I again went back to the Cutler Ridge Court 
House and explained the situation- they printed out another certified copy 
of my marriage certificate, but it was still on fax paper as this is the 
paper they used in there printers.  Again, the drivers license office denied 
the document.  At this point, when I went back to the Court House, I asked 
to speak with a supervisor, who informed me that there was nothing the mater 
with the document and that there was no reason for the drivers license to 
continue to refuse it.  This was repeated two more times, with me going back 
and forth between the drivers license officer and the Cutler Ridge Court 
house.
Nobody was budging, and nobody was willing to call there other.

What was I to do?

Many years later, during a custody issue it was brought up that I was using 
my previous married name on my license.  I testified in court the above 
situation and the judge stated that it would be in my best interest to get 
this resolved, having nothing to do with the custody issues at hand.  It was 
a suggestion, one that I again tried to resolve.

I again went to the cutler ridge court house, this time I went back three 
times, with the drivers license still refusing to accept the paper my 
marriage certificate was printed on by the court house.

What was I to do?  I simply showed ID the last time that I went to renew my 
drivers license, and signed it Michele Ripley.

Now, I find out that apparently someone complained that I was using the name 
of Corbin and an investigation was apparently iniated, without ever 
discussing the situation with me.  When I spoke with your fraud division and 
explained the above situation, and they pulled up my drivers license, they 
did indeed see that I signed it Michele Ripley.  All they could tell me was 
that they could not believe I was allowed to sign it that way.

What is there to believe- my name is Michele Ripley and that's how I sign my 
documents.

I do not feel it is fair to have my drives license cancelled, nor do I feel 
it is fair to have this on my record.  I also do not understand if an 
investigation was done, why am I not entitled to the reports.  I am not a 
minor, I am an adult, this investigation was done in regards to me.  Can 
anyone just report something and you guys take it at face value?  Without 
even speaking to the individual in question?  This can not be the case.

I would appreciate ANY assistance your office can provide on these two 
matters.

Thank you
Michele Ripley

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:

 

I had sent you five pages of information in regards to the situation that occurred in your state of Florida in Starke Florida, Bradford County.  It show the evidence and facts that under the circumstance of unfair justice I did not receive adequate or fair legal representation by legal law standards.  It is a huge shame that the Criminal Report Sheet obtained From the FDLE does not even reflect the appropriate data and a charge has been alter to imply something more damaging to my career through defamation of character. 

 

I feel this is your problem not mine since you have been selected to ensure the safety and protection for your citizens and other people fair and legal practices.  I am sure your attention is thin with the numerous task and challenges you face, but you must realize that this is a small building block into higher levels of crime. I did not fall into this situation by accident but by carelessness, unfair, and illegal justice.

 

It is your system that is not within its proper function. I have read articles in regards to prison and jail investigation which emphasis was placed upon incorporating safety measure to counteract inappropriate police and system operations to omit severe breach of contract to protect and preserve the people within the Constitution by United State Law, yet I saw for myself that these methods did not prevent but inflicted more hidden abuses and corruption omitting the Constitution completely.

 

They had even attempted to force me into signing a waiver because they had known that they were in legal violation. I do not  understand how they could see they violated the law and wanted to ensure their legal protect for legal recourse through force and coercion tactics when has the legal law become a game against the people of United States.  I believe that it becomes a criminal intention only when they recognize their wrong and attempt to fix it, so I understand your confusion along with mine. I realize you are not an attorney, yet some one is an attorney within your power. I had contacted numerous attorneys not to receive a return telephone call from one. So, it the law with barrier to justice or not?  Does it make the Constitution just a piece of paper and you without legal reason to be in office since that is the main bases for these official positions to preserve that one piece of paper that stands for many.

 

Sincerely Yours;

This was returned to me and I wanted someone to know how I feel.  I am not only a voter I am also a victim of this so called Florida Justice System.  I realize that does not matter to you or anyone else in the political force.  There is nothing in it for the politician so let's ignore it and maybe they will go away.
 
At least Mark Foley actually listened and made an attempt to help me for 11 years.  I am not condoning what has transpired in his situation but I can assure you he was the only Republican you had this year worthy of re-election.  So what does that tell you?  

I have been asked to speak before Supreme Court of Florida on Fairness in the Florida State Courts System.
 
According to their past 17 years of surveys the exact same problems exist that they found existed 17 years ago.  The mind boggling fact is that you keep having victims come in and speak, you confirm that yes this is wrong, yes something needs to be done.  NEXT...
 
My question is when is something actually going to be done?  It won't happen in our lifetime yet there are families being torn apart by the very justice system they put their faith in.  
 
I would love to meet with someone in your office while I am in Tallahasse giving my ten  minute speech on October 20, 2006.  I will only be in town that one day and would give you facts, dates, cases, etc. that you can review later if needed.  I would not need to take up much of your time.  I realize you are very busy especially since this is an election year.
 
I gave my first speech in Miami last January and was told the committee was moved by it and invited me to speak again.  Gladly I will take off work and do just that.  However, I want to meet with someone that actually cares in your office about mothers and fathers torn from their children needlessly.  
 
I am enclosing my email that was sent back that I emailed to Mark Foley as well as my address and contact numbers.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Foley,

I just wanted you to know that despite all of this news coverage, I feel you did a great job.  You are the only one in this State of Florida that ever made an effort that went further than the standard letter.  

Believe me I contacted every politician and you actually made me feel like my votes were not in vain.  This has been an ongoing 11 year experience with you and I personally am glad I voted for you.

You made calls to me and discussed my concerns.  You also made calls to the courts on my behalf or had your assistants try, even though there really was nothing you could do.  I will personally will miss having you in the political scene.  I have a very poor view of our government and you were one of the brighter lights in that scene.

As far as your sexual preference, that is no ones business but yours and the consenting adult.  I lost my brother to AIDS in 1992.  There is not a day I don't wish he was here.  He hid his gayness to the point of getting married.  My father was an alcoholic until he died.  Both of them were good caring people.  

I don't know what your future will be but I wanted you to know that you will always be in my prayers.

Subject:	My Brother David Tywater

Dear Governor Bush: 

I am writing this letter in desperation. On September 17, 20006 my brother was taken from the a cruise ship as we docked in Galveston, Texas. We were returning from a week long cruise celebrating my sisters wedding. It seems that there had been a law suite filed against him by someone in Florida and even though he was unaware of this, he is considered a fugitive and arrested. He was removed from the ship by officials in front of his 9 year old son who was scared to death. He was locked in the Galveston jail for either 2 or 3 days before he was allowed to call us. We could not get one answer out of the law enforcement there. It was over a week and a half before he was taken before a judge and finally told what was going on. Then another 4 days before he was allowed to sign extradition papers. He is a 39 year old man who will no doubtably loose the company he has worked very hard to build at the hands of this legal system that we call our foundation. My brothers business partner has taken all the necessary documentation and turned himself in Florida and bonded out within 30 minutes. We were also told by our attorneys that there should be no problem proving these men are innocent with the materials my brothers business partner submitted. The problem is we were also told the state you govern, Florida can take up to 90 days to come and get my brother. Can you even imagine what this type of miss-understanding would do to your family should this happen to you? No means of support while being locked up, looking your business - your lively hood? It was my understanding that a person was innocent until proven guilty, they were charged bonded out and continued living until going to court. My brother has not been allowed to do so. He sits in this jail humiliated and embarrassed at the hands of the very legal system that is supposed to serve and protect us. What sort of justice is this. How are we as parents suppose to teach our children to have faith in our legal system and that they will be treated fairly until they are proven guilty if ever accused of a crime. My brother has no rights as far as we can tell. He is a very clean cut business man sitting in a nasty jail and we seem to have no where to turn. I am begging your office to check into the practices of your legal system located in Pensacola Florida. If they have all the necessary papers and all is in order, don't you think they should collect those they have accused so that we may have some closure. I fear that my brother can not take 60 more days (mentally or financially) of waiting on a legal system that has thus far failed him greatly. Can you offer some type of explanation for this type of justice? Do you honestly think this type of treatment will have no effects on my brother. Can you explain how your state has this type of power. You had him arrested and now you are doing nothing to help and everything to ensure he loose everything. Would you want this type of treatment for one of your children? Does your state offer any type of assistance to those who have lost everything at the hands of your government (financially or mentally)? Should states have extradition rights with those that would leave someone in jail until they lost everything including their sanity? Please offer my brother some type of hope, tell us what to do or at the very least find out what the hold up is and send someone to get my brother so we can end this night mare.

Warren 

Why don't you pass this to Jeb maybe he will actually read the e-mail
and try to understand it because you don't have a clue?


You're not getting it at all yes everyone is concerned about sexual
predators but if you are creating them by the laws you have in place and
fail to read the statistics and realize you are wrong then what have you
really done.

The laws affecting juveniles are causing less reporting and creating
more predators 
I will again tell you so maybe you might pay attention

1 in 4 male juveniles are molested by other juveniles
1 in 3 female juveniles are molest by other juveniles

They are not reported because your laws are not set up to help them

So they are not reported and continue to molest others and grow up to be
molesting other. 

You find some of them as adults the ones you created by ignoring the
bigger picture when they were juveniles

Again 90% can lead positive lives if they receive treatment and in the
future you will not be dealing with them as adults

Take off your blinders or is it easier to point the finger and say they
are all bad rather then start to solve the problem

Don't talk around the facts try actually answering the questions this is
a hot issue and politicians need to pay attention


Thanks
Hugh

Subject: RE: The real moral dilemma

Dear Mr. Shrager:

Thank you for your letter explaining your views and opinions.  Governor
Bush is glad you took the time to share your perspective and asked me to
respond on his behalf.
 
Governor Bush believes sexual crimes against children are among the most
heinous imaginable.  The Governor encourages citizens to be ever
vigilant and to promote awareness of sexual offenders and sexual
predators living within their communities.  If you suspect a child is in
any danger, notify your local law enforcement or the Department of
Children and Families' hot line, 1-800-96-ABUSE.
 
As a concerned citizen, you have the opportunity to influence
legislation by contacting your local legislative delegation.  You may
wish to write to your senator or representative.  Governor Bush wants to
know how Floridians feel about the many critical issues we face, and
promises to keep your ideas in mind as he forms policy for addressing
these concerns.

The Governor appreciates your concerns about Mark Foley's conduct.
Needless to say, the Governor is very disappointed.   Governor Bush
asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to begin an inquiry.
Because there is also an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, FDLE will be coordinating with the FBI, the lead agency
in the investigation. 

Thank you again for writing.  Governor Bush appreciates your concerns
about this serious issue and hopes this information is helpful.
 
Sincerely,
 
Warren Davis
Office of Citizens' Services

Jeb
 
It is easy to point fingers and say how a person like Foley is a
horrible person and oh yeah he was molested when he was young. Maybe a
better approach to this is to bring out some real numbers. 1 in 4 male
children are molested and 1 in 3 female children are molested.
 
The law is setup not to help people who report it but to destroy them.
The alternative is to not report it and allow those children to commit
acts against other children or grow up and commit acts against other
teens.
 
Teen age pregnancy was a quiet secret till it became a big issue and
then we had family planning and other groups to help and support a big
problem.
 
Child molestation by other children is even bigger and all we do is put
them in JDC then wait till they commit other acts and put them in prison
 
Why not take this opportunity to step to the front of the line and do
something that would save our kids our teens and even lower the
molestation by working with them when they are young.
 
Statistically if you work them through a program they can be a positive
part of society 90% can live good lives
 
The other choice is to keep building prisons and to know that if your
kids were really honest you would find that they have dealt with this
but not told you
 
And when you gather a group of people together remember 1 in 4 and 1 in
3 and think of how many people are in the room with you who have been
molested and never got treatment because everyone was afraid to talk
 
How sad is life when we put our heads in the sand 
 
And yes I am available to speak to you any time
 
Let really make a difference
 
Thanks
Hugh

Since the last hearing with General Magistrate Joe Lovelace on April 27th 2006 the defendant filed another motion and also hired an attorney (Karen Glover) to accompany him to the hearing with Judge Cynthia Newton on July 11, 2006. Judge Newton referred the case back to General Magistrate Joe Lovelace but I have been unable to get a final hearing set because of the continuous delays by the defendant and his attorney. After the hearing on July 11, I was asked by Karen Glover to provide a copy of the buyers order on the purchase of my car which includes a balance due on the car in question (2003 Ford Focus). I provided that information on August 14, 2006 and tried repeatedly to contact Karen Glovers office to confirm receipt and ask for final hearing to be set. I did not get a return call until September 18, 2006, which was after call the Bar Association and Consumer Services, and at that time I was informed that there was still no hearing date, that she had sent me a copy of a referral to return to the General Magistrate and to inform me that her office will be closed from September 22 through October 9, 2006. 
I implore you to allow me to schedule the final hearing date so that I can go on with my life. I informed Governor Bush regarding this ordeal and they referred me to a Legal Hotline where I was informed(26 September) that I could file a motion for the final hearing. I cannot afford an attorney and should not need one because this is a simple divorce. I appreciate anything you and your office can do to help me finalize this divorce.

Importance:	High

I am writing to you to give you an update on this matter which has turned
for the worse. On Friday evening my wife's ex husband called here and made
threats to her upon her return to Florida. Thus we cancelled our trip
immediately and hoped for the safety of her children and herself. Hoping the
law would help us out but it has not
On the advice of counsel up here we contacted
the courthouse in St. Lucie County. They held the hearing by telephone
without my wife having legal representation. They pretty much called her a
liar by saying she did not hold credible evidence considering our flight for
safety and changing the children's schools as well as some other things.
They have ordered my wife to pay all of the abuser's attorney costs. they
have ordered us back to Florida, they threatened jail time. they have given
the abuser "unsupervised" visitation with the words "if there is abuse the
proof will be in the pudding upon their return" Thus allowing the abuser to
continue his control, to possibly hurt the children and to force me to take
them to an unsafe area close enough where a man who threatened the life of
my wife could one day carry out his threat. This is certainly a travesty of
justice where once again the abuser in Florida courts using laws for the
good people of Florida can continue his harassment and abuse.

Dear Governor Bush,
I have tried over and over again to get help legally but no one seems to 
care. My wife is a victim of domestic abuse, her children were abused and 
the abuser is using the court system to continue his mission of abuse. We 
escaped and now she is in danger of going to jail or worse losing the 
children. These children have developed greatly since they have been set 
free, their school performance , their social performance and just 
everything has been improved upon. Now we are being forced to comply with 
laws that were designed for the good people of Florida, not the scum bag 
wife and child beaters. Governor, I feel like a failure because I can not 
protect my family from harm. I have the legal system working against me and 
I have to take them back into a harmful situation where I can not guarantee 
their safety. Governor, I know you do not give legal help, but please I beg 
you, please step in and help me keep these wonderful people safe and out of 
harms way. Please step in to the court system and help me protect my family.

I thank the Governor for his kind response.

As I understand the answer the Attorney General who is part of the executive 
branch has little or no role with the Local State Attorneys that are members 
of the executive branch. Local Judges are elected but part of the Judicial 
system. Election does not make a position independent of the rules or the 
law but have the same responsibilities of appointed officials. Everyone is 
required to follow the law and no one is above the law.

It may be possible to ask the Attorney Generals office to make an inquiry 
without an suggestion of pressure or improper interference.

The Chief executive is sworn to see the laws are fairly executed and support 
and defend the constitution. The laws include the application of the civil 
and criminal laws - he has the power to remove Judges or State Attorneys 
that are in gross violation of the law or ask the Judicial Review counsels 
or the Supreme Court to see if there is the chance of public corruption or 
executive prejudice or incompetence.

Thank you - see attached -

Dear Mr. Pflaum:

Thank you for your letter to Governor Bush.  The Governor asked me to 
respond.

As you may know, the decision to charge a person for crimes is made by the 
state attorney, a locally elected official.  Deciding whether or not to 
charge a person is based on the best interests of justice and on the 
quantity and quality of the evidence of criminal activity.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor's intervention in matters that 
should be resolved through the court system.  If you believe you are 
innocent, or not guilty of all charges, you may wish to obtain the services 
of an attorney experienced in criminal defense. If you need assistance in 
locating an attorney, please call the Florida Bar's Referral Service at 
1-800-342-8011.  Those who are facing criminal charges for which prison time 
is a possibility, may be appointed an attorney by the court.  Governor Bush 
does not have the ability to intervene in this regard.  For further 
assistance in this regard, please contact the office of your locally elected 
public defender.  Please be sure the attorney is provided with all of the 
evidence you believe shows innocence.

For further assistance with the probate issues you described, I encourage 
you to seek assistance from private legal counsel.

The Governor trusts justice will be served in this case.

Attachments:	RE: Charges for Foley

Well just to make myself clear, NO ONE has anything to fear from me, it's me that feels very threatened by Mark Foley. As a survivors of sexual abuse for 8 years as a child, myself, I can't allow this Pedophile to walk freely around. I have to insist on charges, I have to insist he be a registered sexual offender. I don't want to hear his name in "5 YEARS" invovled in yet another innocent child's life, who just happened NOT to have received the earlier memo on Mark Foley. I don't want him going to the NEXT LEVEL ............It's not up to me as to any punishment due him and I'll not hurt a hair on his head or anyones elses, but I will scream clear to heavens doors and as far as the outer limits allows me. Our leaders are expected to handle this not as a political figure they only need to dress up for votes. It will not fly with me. I expect you and your brother, to show real leadership, real protection President Bush claims he does for the American people. 
Mark Foley failed to seek help, he deceived right up until ABC NEWS broke the story. His seeking treament for "drinking" now, is toooo little toooo late...........He must be registered as a sex offender, he must be charged...................
Mark Foley's day in court, to be faced with his peers and their judgement is what I seek. AND THATS ALL I SEEK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank-you

Dear Teressa:

Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush.  The Governor appreciates and shares your concerns about Mark Foley's conduct.  

Needless to say, he is very disappointed.   Governor Bush has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to begin an inquiry.  Because there is also an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FDLE will be coordinating with the FBI, the lead agency in the investigation.

Thank you for sharing your concerns with the Governor.

Dear Governor Bush:

Exactly when are charges going to be made on this pedifile Foley? What he 
did was a crime but you all seem to care more about the Rep Party than the 
young boy who was invovled. I demand charges on Foley, or A swear Bin 
Laden can have the whole U. S. government far as I care. I'll call it 
justice for the American children.  No charges on Foley, amounts to giving 
every pedifile a green light to do more crimes against children. If you 
don't file charges on Foley than your as guilty as he is.  What good was 
it for this young boy to speak up for him self. You all say "tell someone" 
but see telling does little to no good for the victims.  Our leaders are 
sick puppies and we need to replace every single one of you. Prove me 
wrong and get those charges against Foley

One more thing, Mr. Bush.  Before you brush this aside, imagine if it was your daughter this was happening to.

Subject:        Florida Statute 61.13 
Importance:     High 

	Dear Mr. Bush,  (Grab a cup of coffee...This is about 3 pages but it's worth your time.) 

	As a FORCED resident of Florida and a conservative, I am asking you to read the following.  Earlier this year you signed an amendment to Florida Statute 61.13, although I don't believe you actually understand the consequences of such a law.  I am a VICTIM of its prior form, and I am begging you for your help.  I already wrote your office about this matter earlier this year.  I received a response that said it was not within your power or area of responsibility...something like that, but IT IS WITHIN YOUR POWER to get SOMEONE to help me.  YOU SIGNED THIS AMENDMENT, therefore YOU HAVE A HAND IN MY IMPRISONMENT.

	I wake up every day knowing that there are bars around me.  You can liken it to being accused and imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit.  Yes, the bars are 100 miles wide, but they are just as oppressive and mentally unbearable.  Worse, because my new husband fell in love with me, he had to make the choice to voluntarily imprison his own self.  Do you have any idea of how this feels?

	I've already tried the legal system.  You have to help us.  You helped Terry Schiavo and she was brain-dead.  We're not brain-dead.  We're living, feeling, contributing members of this United States society, and we deserve the same freedoms as any other law-abiding member of this country.

	THE UNACCEPTABLE DETAILS: 

	Almost 3 years ago my ex-husband left me for his mistress.  He had cheated with different women and left once before.  He had cheated when I was 5 months pregnant with our son.  He cheated a couple of months after our son was born, left me, only to return home a few months later.  He finally left for good when our son was 2-years old for his latest conquest, which he married and has a daughter with now.

	Thank God for unanswered prayers, as the Garth Brooks song goes.  Unfortunately Florida is a No-Fault state, and please dont think this message has to do with division of property.  I dont care about that at all.  What I do care about is a total lack of respect for my personal freedom, feelings and Constitutional Rights!!  Considering his total lack of moral character, I am not surprised that my ex is comfortable still violating my rights.  What is totally unacceptable and surprising is that the State of Florida and the County of Hillsborough has backed him up and unjustly imprisoned my current family and me, apparently for the next 13 years!!

	During our divorce proceedings, my ex and I had attended a mandatory mediation hearing where we signed a Pre-Judgment Agreement.  Before signing that, the Geographic Restriction section had been crossed out.  Instead of rubber-stamping our Agreement in her Final Judgment, the judge in our case injected a statement in our Judgment that said I could not relocate with our son further than 100 miles without her permission or that of my exs.  In hindsight I realize I should have appealed it at the time, but I didnt think much of it then.  Surely I thought that if a genuine opportunity for life advancement came along, the judge would rule in my favor.  Was I ever wrong!!!

	A few years ago, apparently at the urging of actively lobbying men's groups, the Florida law concerning child relocation was changed.  Formerly the State assumption was in favor of relocation, given that the move was for valid, non-vindictive reasons and not intended just to interfere with the other parent's visitation.  The Florida law governing relocation at the time of my court case was Florida Statute 61.13(2)(d):

	d) No presumption shall arise in favor of or against a request to relocate when a primary residential parent seeks to move the child and the move will materially affect the current schedule of contact and access with the secondary residential parent. In making a determination as to whether the primary residential parent may relocate with a child, the court must consider the following factors: 

	1. Whether the move would be likely to improve the general quality of life for both the residential parent and the child. 

	2. The extent to which visitation rights have been allowed and exercised. 
3. Whether the primary residential parent, once out of the jurisdiction, will be likely to comply with any substitute visitation arrangements. 

	4. Whether the substitute visitation will be adequate to foster a continuing meaningful relationship between the child and the secondary residential parent. 

	5. Whether the cost of transportation is financially affordable by one or both parties. 
6. Whether the move is in the best interests of the child. 
The UNCONSTITUTIONALITY of this statute is multi-faceted.  This law allows for a judge to override a presumption within the Florida Constitution that a parent knows and acts in the best interest of their children.  With no specific definitions of what constitutes an improvement in "quality of life" and the overriding subjectivity allowed by the 6th measure, biased Florida judges are acting upon their own beliefs, literally imprisoning custodial parents and destroying families' lives.

	If a working mother of two could become a stay-at-home mother, would that be an improvement to quality of life?  What if they could move from a small apartment where her boys shared a room to a 3,000 sq. ft. home, where the boys could have their own rooms and a big backyard?  Would that be an improvement?  ABSOLUTELY NOTNOT ACCORDING TO JUDGE MONICA SIERRA OF HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY.  Fact: Sierra never approves relocations, and the current Florida law allows her to continue as such.  Even when you pass the first 5 measures, Sierra's Orders deny relocation on the basis of the 6th factor.  "Sure, you passed the test, but I don't think so.  I know better than you what's best for your children."

	My own relocation request was based on two promotions, my own and that of my new husband.  (Most relocations are based on one family promotion, so we started the court process feeling pretty confident, especially since my son's visitation with his father was only decreasing by 10 days...75 overnights vs. his then 85.)  Unfortunately my case was assigned to Judge Sierra, and she of course decided that we didn't show any evidence of an improvement.  It didn't matter that the promotions meant $25,000 more per year.  It didn't matter that I had turned down 3 other promotions that would have placed us further away than the South Carolina move we were requesting.  It didn't matter that the house was bigger and on 10 acres, with a lifestyle that we couldn't afford within the state of Florida.  (This was a newer 3,400 sq. ft. house on 10 acres for $324,900.  That would be over $1 million in Florida, and completely out of our reach!) 

	I am not a convicted felon.  I am not a meth addict on welfare.  (If I were, the ACLU would certainly be beating down my door.)  Nonetheless, I am imprisoned by the State of Florida.  My Constitutional rights of DUE PROCESS, PRIVACY, FREEDOM TO TRAVEL and EQUAL PROTECTION have all been squashed.  No big deal?  You cannot imagine the devastating and overwhelming feeling of being trapped, caged within 100 miles, stuck at our current job levels with no hopes or aspirations, AND I AM NOT ALONE.  (I know 5 other women just in Hillsborough County that are in similar situations.)

	Do you understand?  The State of Florida is saying that our families do not deserve to aspire!!!!!!  Theyre saying we can never improve our lives.  My husband and I are both at the top level possible within the state of Florida in our respective industries.  Do you think they have a right to tell us that THIS IS IT?!!  As it stands, the only aspiration were allowed to have is, Gee, we just need to do well enough not to get fired.  Why bother to do better?  It doesnt matter if we deserve to be promoted.  Were not allowed!!  God, please help us.  This is not my America!!!

	Why is my ex husband allowed to make all the immoral choices he made, and the only ones paying the bill are my current family and me?  I didnt do anything, and now the State treats me like Im lucky to have primary residential custody of my son.  Theyre acting like Im not a good mother because I have to work.  Theyre acting like Im not a good mother because I aspire to a better life.  (Please dont misunderstand me.  My life is all about my son.  I work to live.  I dont live to work, but I do deserve to excel in life if my performance proves worthy, just like the next person.)

	This October, the Florida law governing relocation will be changed.  The new law is even more UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  Before addressing that though, consider the impractical process of applying for relocation in the first place.  In my case, I had to accept the promotion before I was able to go before the judge.  Im sure this is true in 95% of the cases.  The court process takes 6+ months, not including appeal.  So I ask you, what corporation is willing to wait more than a few weeks for an answer to an offer of promotion?  Youre forced to roll the dice, major dice.  Youre forced to risk your career, livelihood, finances, happiness and CUSTODY, all in hopes that the judge rules in your favor.  Theres no common sense, fairness or practicality to this system!!

	Lets not pretend its ever based on the actual merits of your case anyway.  Of course, I appealed Judge Sierras appalling decision.  Unfortunately the lead judge on my appellant panel was a divorced father himself.  And I quote, If your client wants to move so badly, why doesnt she just give custody to the father?  (Oh yes.  I should sit quietly and be grateful that my ex cheated on me incessantly, left me, and now I should give up our son in exchange for my freedom.  That sounds fair.  Thank God I had the self-control not to jump that railing and punch him in his fat face!!  One year and $50k later, I was left defeated and close to jobless.  Thankfully, I work for the most wonderful corporation ever and another lateral position surfaced for me in Florida, but I have ZERO chances of ever being promoted now.)

	The late 2006 amended version of Florida Statute 61.13 includes such ridiculous and blatant Constitutional violations as including the rights of 3rd parties.  Its overbearing premise states that if no geographic agreement exists, the State assumes an automatic 50-mile restriction!!  And get a load of the following factor it considers

	 The current employment and economic circumstances of each parent 
or other person and whether or not the proposed relocation is necessary to 
improve the economic circumstances of the parent or other person seeking 
relocation of the child.  

	Im sorry.  Do I understand that correctly?  Is this America?  Are they saying that the State has the right to determine if I need to make more money?!!

	Look, I dont have a bunch of money to spend on this, but I need help.  I feel like suing the State is my only option at this point.  Please, what are my options?  Who can and will help me?  Please, I cannot, should not and will not live like this for the next 13 years.

	Your time, help and consideration are greatly appreciated.  Thank you and God Bless.
